# COVID-19 Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions

This dataset documents non-pharmaceutical interventions in Canada 
to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be used as a resource to estimate
the effect of interventions or to compare interventions across different populations.
It is meant to be immediately helpful for healthcare workers and policy makers.
It is sourced from public reports by the government and accredited news media.

In order to make clear the process that led to the construction of this dataset, 
it's ongoing suitability for use, and the potentials for misuse, we will follow
the [Datasheets for Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf) framework below.
