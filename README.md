# COVID-19 Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions

This dataset documents non-pharmaceutical interventions in Canada 
to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be used as a resource to estimate
the effect of interventions or to compare interventions across different populations.
It is meant to be immediately helpful for healthcare workers and policy makers.
It is sourced from public reports by federal, provincial, territorial, and regional governments as well as accredited news media.
