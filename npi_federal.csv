The Government of Canada continues to monitor the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, and is constantly determining what new measures may be required to contain the spread of the virus.

To that end, today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Marc Garneau, announced that the Government of Canada is introducing new domestic transportation measures to support provincial, territorial and local efforts to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spreading from travelling within Canada.

These new measures include:

Air

A requirement for all air operators to conduct a health check of travellers before they board a flight within Canada or departing from Canada, based on guidance from the Public Health Agency of Canada. This would include asking health questions, looking for visible signs of illness prior to boarding, and recommending the traveller follow guidance from local health authorities.
A requirement for air operators to refuse boarding to a passenger that presents COVID-19 symptoms. The denial will remain in effect for a period of 14 days, or until a medical certificate is presented that confirms that the traveller’s symptoms are not related to COVID-19. These measures will apply to aircraft with 10 seats or more.
A requirement for air operators to notify travellers that they may be subject to provincial or territorial measures at their final destination.
These measures will come into effect on March 30, 2020 at noon EDT.
Rail
A requirement for intercity passenger rail companies to do a health check to screen passengers for COVID-19 symptoms before they board a train, based on guidance from the Public Health Agency of Canada. This will include company representatives asking simple health questions, looking for visible signs of illness prior to boarding, and recommending the passenger follow guidance from local health authorities. 
A requirement for intercity passenger rail companies to refuse boarding to a passenger that presents COVID-19 symptoms. The denial will remain in effect for a period of 14 days, or until a medical certificate is presented that confirms that the traveller’s symptoms are not related to COVID-19.
These measures do not apply to commuter trains.
These measures will come into effect on March 30, 2020 at noon EDT.
We remain in contact on a daily basis with the key transportation industry partners, operators and employee associations, international counterparts including in the United States and Europe, as well as provincial and territorial governments to assist with efforts in response to COVID-19.

Student loan repayment will be suspended until September 30th, 2020:
If you are registered for pre-authorized debit, they will be automatically stopped so you do not have to do anything.
If you are making payments by cheque or other means, you are not required to make payments during the suspension period.
If you want to continue making payments on your loan, you may do so by logging in to your secure NSLSC account and using the Make a Payment option or through online banking.
Interest will not be charged to borrowers on their student loans from March 30th, 2020 to September 30th, 2020.
If your loan was issued by NL, NB, ON, SK or BC, this applies to both the federal and provincial portions of your student loan.

If your loan was issued by PEI, NS, AB or MB, NSLSC only administers the federal portion of your loan, and therefore, this applies to your Canada Student Loan only. However, your province may already have announced similar measures for the provincial portion of your loan; please contact the issuing province for more information.

Note: It may take some time for these measures to be applied to your NSLSC online account. As such, your student loan account may temporarily reflect incorrect information.

How does the suspension affect you if:

You are still in school
The suspension does not impact your loan since you have no payment to make and interest does not accumulate while you are in-study.

You are in your six-month non-repayment period
Payments are never required during the non-repayment period.

The non-repayment period is already interest-free for Canada, BC and NL loans;
Interest accrues on the provincial portion of the loan for ON, NB and SK; however, between March 30th and September 30th, ON, NB and SK loans will be interest-free.
If your non-repayment period is set to end during the suspension period, payments and interest will automatically be suspended until September 30th and you will start repaying your loan in October 2020.

You have already started to repay your loan
You do not have to do anything; your loan will be interest and payment free until September 30th and you will resume repaying your loan in October 2020. We will provide further information over the coming weeks on repayment options for October.",

The Government of Canada is taking action to protect Canadians and the economy from the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. To help mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on Canada’s tourism industry, Parks Canada will work with tourism operators in national parks, historic sites, and marine conservation areas to defer payments on commercial leases and licences of occupation without interest until September 1, 2020.

Every year, hundreds of tourism businesses and operators deliver a range of services and experiences to the millions of people who visit Parks Canada places across the country. These enterprises are valued partners to Parks Canada and are important contributors to Canada’s tourism industry and to local economies. But many of them are now facing financial challenges due to the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on travel and on Parks Canada operations.

Parks Canada is now contacting all holders of commercial leases and licences of occupation in national parks, historic sites, and marine conservation areas to provide details on the deferral of regular payments without interest until September 1, 2020. Operators will be contacted directly by Parks Canada staff over the coming days. Information will also be made available soon on the Parks Canada website.

The health, safety and well-being of all people in Canada, including First Nations, Inuit and Métis, is and will remain a top priority for all. Canada recognizes that First Nation, Inuit and Métis are among the most vulnerable, and that during this crisis, in particular, those in remote and fly-in only parts of the country are uniquely vulnerable. Communities are incredibly resilient and full of solutions and innovative ideas. This is why we must support distinctions-based measures to improve public health response for Indigenous communities and provide them with the flexibility they need to address the specific needs identified by communities and their members.

Today, the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Indigenous Services outlined the details of the $305 million for the new distinctions-based Indigenous Community Support Fund, to address immediate needs in First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation communities related to COVID-19.

The Indigenous Community Support Fund will be distributed as  follows:

$215 million for First Nations: allocated to each First Nation based on population, remoteness and community well-being;
$45 million for Inuit, which will flow to each of the four land claims organizations through an allocation determined by the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and regional Inuit land claims organizations;
$30 million for Métis Nation communities, which will flow through each of the Governing Members;
$15 million for regional and urban Indigenous organizations supporting their members living away from their communities, and to regional organizations such as Friendship Centres and the Métis Settlements General Council of Alberta.
These new funds will flow directly to Indigenous communities and groups across the country and will provide Indigenous leadership with the flexibility needed to address the immediate needs in their communities as they prepare for and react to the spread of COVID-19. These funds could be used for measures including, but not limited to:

support for Elders and vulnerable community members,
measures to address food insecurity,
educational and other support for children,
mental health assistance and emergency response services,
preparedness measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
The Fund is in addition to the needs-based funding designated for First Nations, Inuit and Metis through the COVID-19 Response Fund announced on March 11, 2020 and to the initial $50 million provided to support the immediate public health response. To support women and children fleeing violence, we have also created a $10 million fund for emergency family violence prevention shelters on reserve and in Yukon, as announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on March 18, 2020.

The Indigenous Community Support Fund is also in addition to needs-based support to address public health issues, including the provision of personal protective equipment, testing and health care personnel. It is also in addition to needs-based funding to address the growth in demand for income assistance and for emergency planning programming.

First Nations, Inuit and Métis will also benefit from all of the government's efforts to support and improve the health response to COVID-19, and to reduce the impact of the situation on workers and businesses. The Government of Canada recognizes more support may be needed and will continue to offer financial support for Indigenous communities to meet their evolving needs.

Indigenous people and businesses are encouraged to review other measures which have been made available through the Government of Canada's COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, through which they may receive further support.

As a reminder, the best way to mitigate the risks associated with COVID-19 is to practice social distancing and frequent hand hygiene and coughing and sneezing etiquette. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as toys and door handles.

Indigenous Services Canada is working fast with quick turnaround times for processing personal protective equipment requests to ensure First Nation communities are ready to respond to COVID-19 as effectively as possible.

Today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, announced an Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act that requires any person entering Canada by air, sea or land to self-isolate for 14 days whether or not they have symptoms of COVID-19.

The order will be fully implemented by the Canada Border Services Agency at points of entry by midnight tonight. The Government of Canada will use its authority under the Quarantine Act to ensure compliance with the order. Failure to comply with this Order is an offense under the Quarantine Act. Maximum penalties include a fine of up to $750,000 and/or imprisonment for six months. Further, a person who causes a risk of imminent death or serious bodily harm to another person while wilfully or recklessly contravening this Act or the regulations could be liable for a fine of up to $1,000,000 or to imprisonment of up to three years, or to both. Spot checks will be conducted by the Government of Canada to verify compliance.

All individuals permitted to enter Canada are subject to this Order, with the exception of certain persons who cross the border regularly to ensure the continued flow of goods and services, and those who provide essential services. Individuals exempt from the Order will still need to practice social distancing and self monitoring and contact their local public health authority if they feel sick.

Individuals displaying symptoms of COVID-19 after arriving in Canada may not use public transportation to travel to their place of isolation. They also may not isolate in a place where they will be in contact with vulnerable people, such as seniors and individuals with underlying health conditions.

Parks Canada is committed to protecting the health and safety of Canadians, visitors, and employees. Despite the suspension of visitor services and closure of facilities on March 19, 2020, high visitation levels have occurred in a number of parks leading to public safety and health concerns, as well as increased risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus. As a result, the Agency is implementing additional measures to support the Government of Canada’s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and reduce risks to all users of Parks Canada places.



To reduce the number of visitors at Parks Canada places and to minimize risks to visitors and employees, Parks Canada is building on actions taken last week and is now temporarily suspending all motor vehicle access by visitors at all national parks, national historic sites, and national marine conservation areas effective 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, March 25, 2020 until further notice. This action is intended to significantly reduce visitation and respects the advice of public health experts to stay home and avoid public gatherings.



These measures are additional to steps taken last week and mean that all visitor parking facilities and associated services at Parks Canada places are closed until further notice. Highways and roadways which pass through Parks Canada places will remain open. Commercial and through traffic is permitted on these corridors. Please note that parking is not permitted on highways and roadways. We are asking all Canadians to respect these restrictions.



Parks Canada will continue to deliver services critical for Canadians, including highway maintenance and snow removal, fire response, dam operations and water management on historic waterways, as well as avalanche forecasting and control, among others.



Indigenous traditional activities in Parks Canada locations will continue, but all users are asked to follow the advice of public health experts on social distancing. Local services are limited. Residents of townsites will still be permitted vehicular access, but those with recreational properties within national parks are strongly encouraged to stay home. Please respect all travel advisories.



To be clear, Parks Canada is asking Canadians to stay home. Anyone considering a visit to a Parks Canada location, including those in urban areas, should cancel their plans as vehicle access for the purposes of visitor use will be suspended until further notice.



We ask that visitors support Canada’s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and cancel any non-essential travel. Detailed information on Parks Canada places and the measures the Agency is taking to limit the spread of COVID-19 can be found at pc.gc.ca. Please check regularly for updates.

The Government of Canada continues to take action to help Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Learn more about the latest measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.

The Government of Canada is taking immediate and significant action to support Canadian individuals and businesses facing financial hardship as a result of the economic impacts of the global COVID-19 outbreak.

Today, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau announced amendments to mortgage insurance eligibility criteria, set out in regulations made under the National Housing Act and Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act. These changes will help provide stable funding and liquidity to financial institutions and mortgage lenders and support continued lending to Canadian businesses and consumers. 

This announcement is in support of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s (CMHC) March 16, 2020 launch of a $50 billion Insured Mortgage Purchase Program (IMPP) and CMHC’s March 20, 2020 announcement on program details. The amendments allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS) for CMHC to purchase these securities through the IMPP. The impact of this measure will provide financial institutions with more liquidity. This, in turn, will allow financial institutions to continue lending to businesses as well as individuals, while assisting customers who face hardship and need flexibility, on a case by case basis. 

This program builds on other measures announced by the government and Bank of Canada to support liquidity and credit to businesses and borrowers in these extraordinary times. These actions are an important part of Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. 

To complement the IMPP, the Minister of Finance is announcing today that the eligibility criteria for portfolio insurance are being temporarily relaxed to help mortgage lenders access the IMPP. This will allow previously uninsured mortgage loans that were funded before March 20, 2020, to be eligible for mortgage insurance and to be included in future NHA MBS issuance.

Effective March 24, 2020, the following low loan-to-value mortgages funded prior to the date of this announcement, March 20, 2020, are eligible for government-guaranteed insurance:

Low loan-to-value mortgages with a maximum amortization term up to 30 years commencing from when the loan was funded.
Low loan-to-value mortgages whose purpose includes the purchase of a property, subsequent renewal of such a loan, or refinancing.
All other eligibility criteria for government-guaranteed insurance will continue to apply to these mortgages. The above amendments will remain in force until December 31, 2020, at which time the eligibility criteria will revert to the existing rules. The Minister of Finance reserves the right to make amendments prior to this date, should circumstances change.

These changes will not apply to low loan-to-value mortgage loans funded on or after March 20, 2020. The other existing criteria which apply for transactional mortgage insurance will remain unchanged.

Quotes
“These are extraordinary times and we are taking extraordinary measures. As a result of this measure, banks and lenders will have more liquidity—which, in turn, will enable them to work on a case by case basis with Canadian businesses and individuals who face hardship at this time. A co-ordinated approach is critical for making sure our economy remains strong and stable. The government will do whatever it takes to support Canadians and we are prepared to take further action as necessary to meet the challenges ahead.”

Quick facts
Federal statutes require federally regulated lenders to obtain mortgage default insurance (“mortgage insurance”) for homebuyers who make a down payment of less than 20 per cent of the property purchase price, known as “high loan-to-value” or “high-ratio” insurance. Lenders also have the option to purchase mortgage insurance for homebuyers who make a down payment of at least 20 per cent of the property purchase price, known as “low-ratio” insurance because the loan amounts are generally low in relation to the value of the home. 


Under the IMPP, CMHC will purchase insured mortgages in the form of National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities—a securitization product that pools insured mortgages for resale as marketable securities.",

days, but may change depending on the state of the pandemic. Flights 
between Canada and the U.S. will still continue.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced $50 million in funding to help vulnerable countries prepare for and respond to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As part of this, Canada will immediately provide $8 million of this funding to experienced humanitarian partners, including the World Health Organization, the Pan-American Health Organization, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

This funding will help respond to the needs of vulnerable populations in developing countries affected by COVID-19, including through increased surveillance systems and infection prevention; provision of water, sanitation and hygiene; protection services; emergency health care; and psychosocial support.

As women and girls are often disproportionately affected by crises, Canada’s partners will incorporate lessons learned from past outbreaks into their response efforts to ensure that their needs are taken into account.

Quotes
“The spread of COVID-19 within developing countries, refugee camps and other at-risk communities is particularly concerning. This emergency funding will help minimize the impact in countries that have health systems that are being particularly challenged. Funds will also support preparedness operations in refugee or displaced camps where health risks are very high. Our message is clear: Canada stands ready to assist, as we all unite to fight this global pandemic.”

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government of Canada has consulted with experts from around the world and supported Canadian researchers to help combat this new coronavirus.

On March 11, 2020, the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, outlined an investment of $275 million to enhance Canada’s capacity in research and development, as part of Canada’s COVID-19 response, including research on medical countermeasures, including antivirals, vaccine development and support for clinical trials.

Thanks to this new investment in research, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Canada’s Minister of Health, today announced the next rollout of $25.8 million, allowing the Government of Canada, through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, to rapidly double the number of COVID-19 research projects funded, adding 49 new projects to the 47 projects previously announced on March 6. That brings the total to 96 projects led by researchers across the country that will focus on developing and implementing measures to rapidly detect, manage, and reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

Quotes
“The outbreak of COVID-19 evolves quickly, and protecting the health of Canadians is our priority. The additional teams of researchers receiving funding today will help Canada quickly generate the evidence we need to contribute to the global understanding of the COVID-19 illness. Their essential work will contribute to the development of effective vaccines, diagnostics, treatments, and public health responses.”

Quick facts
On March 6, the Government of Canada announced an investment of $26.8M over two years to support 47 research projects on coronavirus. Today’s new funding of $25.8M for 49 projects brings the total investment to $52.6M for this research response supporting 96 research teams from across the country.

The Government of Canada provided the funding ($26.8M) for the first wave of COVID-19 research projects through the CIHR, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Canada Research Coordinating Committee (CRCC) through the New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF), the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and Genome Canada (GC).

The research priorities for this call were informed by ongoing dialogue with the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), of which Canada is a member; through Canada’s participation at the World Health Organization (WHO)-GLoPID-R research and innovation forum of February 11-12, 2020 in Geneva; and by the WHO R&D Blueprint on COVID-19.",

The health and safety of Canadians, visitors, and Parks Canada team members is of the utmost importance to the Agency. Parks Canada is following the advice of public health experts and taking steps to support the Government of Canada’s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and reduce risks to visitors, employees, and other users of Parks Canada spaces.



Effective at 12:01 a.m. on Thursday, March 19, 2020, Parks Canada is temporarily suspending all visitor services in all national parks, national historic sites and national marine conservation areas across the country until further notice. The Agency will be monitoring the situation and will communicate regularly.



Parks Canada will limit its activities to basic critical operations and many staff will work from home. Visitor facilities will be closed temporarily, including washrooms and day use facilities. Some conservation activities will also be temporarily suspended, including projects with external researchers.



While visitor services are temporarily suspended, Parks Canada will continue to deliver a number of critical functions, including highway management and snow removal, fire response, dam operations and water management on historic waterways, as well as avalanche forecasting and control, among others.


Visitors may use front country and backcountry areas as well as accessible green spaces. Should Canadians decide to visit, they should remember that they are always responsible for their own safety. They should consult Parks Canada’s website to be prepared for their visit and be aware of any area closures. Search and rescue services may be limited. Visitors should exercise additional caution at this time and avoid activities with safety risks.


There are a number of tourism businesses and operations within Parks Canada places. These operators are valued partners and provide important services to visitors. They may continue to operate and clients should check with them before visiting to ensure that there has been no change to their services.

Parks Canada will cease taking new reservations until April 30, 2020. All existing reservations for this period will be refunded in full. In addition, the Agency is currently developing an approach to honour passes, in light of travel restrictions and closures related to COVID-19. Details will be communicated in due course.


A complete list of Parks Canada places that are closed and the parameters of these closures will be available on the Parks Canada website soon. Please visit pc.gc.ca regularly for updates.

The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today announced a new set of economic measures to help stabilize the economy and help Canadians affected by the impacts of this challenging period.

These measures, delivered as part of the Government of Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, will provide up to $27 billion in direct support to Canadian workers and businesses, plus $55 billion to meet liquidity needs of Canadian businesses and households through tax deferrals to help stabilize the economy. Combined, this $82 billion in support represents more than 3 per cent of Canada’s GDP. This wide-ranging support will help ensure Canadians can pay for rent and groceries, and help businesses continue to pay their employees and their bills during this time of uncertainty.

This plan builds on coordinated action taken since the beginning of this outbreak, including the more than $1 billion COVID-19 Response Fund, which provided funding to provinces and territories to strengthen critical health care systems. It represents over $500 billion in credit and liquidity support for people and businesses through cooperation between financial Crown corporations, the Bank of Canada, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), and commercial lenders to ensure businesses can continue to operate.

The actions announced today are part of Canada’s whole-of-government response to COVID-19. As a first step, this plan aims to stabilize our economy through targeted measures to address immediate challenges faced by workers and businesses alike. It will help ensure that workers have the money they need while they are sick or in isolation, or due to loss of work or a significant reduction in work income, and help support people and businesses experiencing financial hardship because of the outbreak.

Canadians should not make health decisions based on their financial needs. As the situation continues to evolve, further measures will be announced to support Canadians, stimulate the economy, and protect peoples’ jobs and livelihoods..

Support for workers
Canadians should not have to worry about paying their rent or mortgage or buying groceries because of the COVID-19 crisis. To support workers and their families, the Government of Canada is taking action to:

Provide additional assistance to families with children by temporarily boosting Canada Child Benefit payments. This measure would deliver almost $2 billion in extra support.
Introduce an Emergency Care Benefit of up to $900 bi-weekly for up to 15 weeks to provide income support to workers who must stay home and do not have access to paid sick leave. This measure could provide up to $10 billion to Canadians, and includes:
Workers, including the self-employed, who are sick, quarantined, or who have been directed to self-isolate but do not qualify for Employment Insurance (EI) sickness benefits.
Workers, including the self-employed, who are taking care of a family member who is sick with COVID-19, such as an elderly parent or other dependents who are sick, but do not qualify for EI sickness benefits.
EI-eligible and non EI-eligible working parents who must stay home without pay because of children who are sick or who need additional care because of school closures.
Introduce an Emergency Support Benefit delivered through the Canada Revenue Agency to provide up to $5 billion in support to workers who are not eligible for EI and who are facing unemployment.
Provide additional assistance to individuals and families with low and modest incomes with a special top-up payment under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) credit. This measure would inject $5.5 billion in the economy.
Waive, for a minimum of six months, the mandatory one-week waiting period for EI sickness benefits for workers in imposed quarantine or who have been directed to self-isolate, as announced on March 11.
Waive the requirement for a medical certificate to access EI sickness benefits.
Extend the tax filing deadline for individuals to June 1, and allow all taxpayers to defer, until after August 31, 2020, the payment of any income tax amounts that become owing on or after today and before September 2020. This relief would apply to tax balances due, as well as instalments, under Part I of the Income Tax Act.  No interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this period. This measure will result in households having more money available during this period.
Provide eligible small businesses a 10 per cent wage subsidy for the next 90 days, up to a maximum of $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer. Employers benefiting from this measure would include corporations eligible for the small business deduction, as well as not-for-profit organisations and charities.  This will help employers keep people on their payroll and help Canadians keep their jobs.
Provide increased flexibility to lenders to defer mortgage payments on homeowner government-insured mortgage loans to borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties related to the outbreak. Insurers will permit lenders to allow payment deferral beginning immediately.
In addition, to provide targeted support for vulnerable groups, the Government is investing to:

Reduce minimum withdrawals from Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) by 25 per cent for 2020 in recognition of volatile market conditions and their impact on many seniors’ retirement savings.
Implement a six-month, interest-free, moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments for all individuals who are in the process of repaying these loans.
Provide $305 million for a new distinctions-based Indigenous Community Support Fund, to address immediate needs in First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation communities.
Support women and children fleeing violence by providing up to $50 million to women’s shelters and sexual assault centres to help with their capacity to manage or prevent an outbreak in their facilities. This includes funding for facilities in Indigenous communities.
Provide an additional $157.5 million to address the needs of Canadians experiencing homelessness through the Reaching Home program.
Support for businesses
In the face of an uncertain economic situation and tightening credit conditions, the Government is taking action to help affected businesses. To support Canadian businesses and help them retain their workers during this difficult time, the Government is announcing measures to:

Allow all businesses to defer, until after August 31, 2020, the payment of any income tax amounts that become owing on or after today and before September 2020. This relief would apply to tax balances due, as well as instalments, under Part I of the Income Tax Act. No interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this period. This measure will result in businesses having more money available during this period.
Increase the credit available to small, medium, and large Canadian businesses. As announced on March 13, a new Business Credit Availability Program will provide more than $10 billion of additional support to businesses experiencing cash flow challenges through the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada. The Government is ready to provide more capital through these financial Crown corporations.
Further expand Export Development Canada’s ability to provide support to domestic businesses.
Provide flexibility on the Canada Account limit, to allow the Government to provide additional support to Canadian businesses, when deemed to be in the national interest, to deal with exceptional circumstances.
Augment credit available to farmers and the agri-food sector through Farm Credit Canada.
Launch an Insured Mortgage Purchase Program to purchase up to $50 billion of insured mortgage pools through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). As announced on March 16, this will provide stable funding to banks and mortgage lenders and support continued lending to Canadian businesses and consumers. CMHC stands ready to further support liquidity and the stability of the financial markets through its mortgage funding programs as necessary. The Government will enable these measures by raising CMHC’s legislative limits to guarantee securities and insure mortgages by $150 billion each.
The six largest financial institutions in Canada have made a commitment to work with personal and small business banking customers on a case-by-case basis to provide flexible solutions to help them manage through challenges, such as pay disruption due to COVID-19, childcare disruption due to school or daycare closures, or those suffering from COVID-19. As a first step, this support will include up to a six-month payment deferral for mortgages, and the opportunity for relief on other credit products. The Government of Canada will continue to monitor evolving economic conditions and seek greater relief measures should it be necessary.

In order to move forward with implementing these new measures needed to provide timely support for Canadians and to ensure the Government has every tool at its disposal to address potential challenges that may arise, the Government intends to introduce special legislation and seek the approval of Parliament.

The Government of Canada will continue to take further action as required to prioritize the health and safety of Canadians, stabilize the economy, and mitigate the economic impact of this pandemic.

Early diagnosis and isolation of patients infected with COVID-19 are essential to slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus across Canada. Since the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of a cold or flu, diagnostic testing is important for clinical care and public health management.

To assist with Canada’s response to COVID-19, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, announced that she has signed an Interim Order to allow expedited access to COVID-19-related medical devices for use by healthcare providers, including diagnostic test kits.

The need for test kits is growing as the number of COVID-19 cases increases across Canada.

This Interim Order will help ensure quicker and more flexible approval of the importation and sale of medical devices that are necessary for Canada’s response to COVID-19, including test kits. With the Interim Order, two new diagnostic tests are made readily accessible in Canada:

the Roche Molecular Systems Inc. cobas SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic device; and
the ThermoFisher Scientific TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kit
This Interim Order may also help ensure Canadian access to other marketed COVID-19-related medical devices used to treat, mitigate or prevent COVID-19, as necessary.

With this Interim Order, Health Canada could also look to approvals granted by foreign regulatory authorities in deciding whether to approve an application for the importation or sale of COVID-19-related medical devices. Existing devices, where the approved, intended use was not originally COVID-19-related, could also be expanded under this Interim Order.

An Interim Order is one of the fastest mechanisms available to the Government of Canada to help make health products available to address larger scale public health emergencies. This Interim Order provides the Minister with the flexibility to consider the urgent circumstances relating to the need for the medical device, authorizations granted by foreign regulatory authorities, or possible new uses for medical devices that are approved in Canada.

As with all drugs and medical devices, Health Canada will assess and monitor the safety and effectiveness of the devices accessed under this Interim Order once they are on the market, and will take immediate action to protect the health and safety of Canadians if necessary.

Quick facts
Health Canada has now authorized the sale and importation of two new diagnostic test kits:

the Roche Molecular Systems Inc. cobas SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic device; and

Interim Orders remain in effect for 14 days, and can be extended for up to one year by the Governor in Council, after which they may be renewed if required.

Before the introduction of the Interim Order, Health Canada enabled access to diagnostic test kits via the Special Access Program (SAP).

Canadians who experience symptoms of COVID-19 should stay home and call the public health authority in their province or territory to inform them and obtain advice on what they should do.",

The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs, is providing an update on the COVID-19 Emergency Loan Program for Canadians Abroad, as announced by the Prime Minister today.

In light of the multiple measures implemented by governments throughout the world to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Government of Canada advises Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside Canada until further notice.

Many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions and other measures such as movement restrictions and quarantines. Airlines have cancelled flights. New restrictions may be imposed with little warning. Your travel plans may be severely disrupted.

The government is recommending that travellers find out what options are still available to return to Canada and consider returning as soon as possible. Canadians seeking to return now face reduced commercial travel options and may experience a sudden spike in prices.

To help Canadians abroad return home, the Government of Canada is creating a special financial assistance program, the COVID-19 Emergency Loan Program for Canadians Abroad. With this program, Canadian abroad directly impacted by COVID-19 will have the option of applying for an emergency loan of up to $5,000 to help secure their timely return to Canada and to temporarily cover their life-sustaining needs while they work toward their return.

In addition, the Government of Canada will provide additional support to Canadians directly affected by COVID-19 and unable to immediately return home. This support will be provided through new partnerships with local and other organizations and will complement existing consular services.

The Government of Canada encourages all Canadians abroad to register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service to get the latest updates on the situation at their destination.

Eligible Canadians currently outside Canada who need financial assistance can contact us at CAN.finances.CV19@international.gc.ca.

For all other consular emergencies, Canadians can contact the nearest Government of Canada office or Global Affairs Canada’s 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at +1 613-996-8885 (collect calls are accepted where available) or email sos@international.gc.ca.

The Government of Canada is doing everything it can to protect the health and safety of all Canadians as the country responds to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and that includes its own workforce.

Yesterday, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) provided additional guidance to departments and agencies with the expectation that managers will consider telework for all their employees, at all work sites, while ensuring continued critical government operations and services to Canadians.

The Government will continue to support federal employees from coast to coast to coast, who are now working around the clock – many of them on the front line-- to deliver programs and services and provide guidance based on sound public policy and science.

We are focused on ensuring federal organizations have the guidance they need and plans in place to be ready for all eventualities.

Advice and guidance on human resources, and occupational health and safety is based on science-based health advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada and occupational health advice from Health Canada, informed by guidance from provincial, territorial and local health authorities across the country.

To help employers keep and return workers to their payroll through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, announced the new Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy on March 27, 2020. This would provide a 75-per-cent wage subsidy to eligible employers for up to 12 weeks, retroactive to March 15, 2020. 

This wage subsidy aims to prevent further job losses, encourage employers to re-hire workers previously laid off as a result of COVID-19, and help better position Canadian companies and other employers to more easily resume normal operations following the crisis. While the Government has designed the proposed wage subsidy to provide generous and timely financial support to employers, it has done so with the expectation that employers will do their part by using the subsidy in a manner that supports the health and well-being of their employees.

Eligible Employers
Eligible employers would include individuals, taxable corporations, partnerships consisting of eligible employers, non-profit organizations and registered charities.

Public bodies would not be eligible for this subsidy. Public bodies would generally include municipalities and local governments, Crown corporations, wholly owned municipal corporations, public universities, colleges, schools and hospitals.

This subsidy would be available to eligible employers that see a drop of at least 15 per cent of their revenue in March 2020 and 30 per cent for the following months (see Eligible Periods). In applying for the subsidy, employers would be required to attest to the decline in revenue.

We encourage all eligible employers to rehire employees as quickly as possible and to apply for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy if they are eligible. To ensure that the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) applies as intended, the Government will consider implementing an approach to limit duplication.  This could include a process to allow individuals rehired by their employer during the same eligibility period to cancel their CERB claim and repay that amount.

Calculating Revenues
An employer’s revenue for this purpose would be its revenue in Canada earned from arm’s-length sources. Revenue would be calculated using the employer’s normal accounting method, and would exclude revenues from extraordinary items and amounts on account of capital.

Today, the government is clarifying that employers would be allowed to calculate their revenues under the accrual method or the cash method, but not a combination of both. Employers would select an accounting method when first applying for the CEWS and would be required to use that method for the entire duration of the program.

For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation will include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. These organizations would be allowed to choose whether or not to include revenue from government sources as part of the calculation. Once chosen, the same approach would have to apply throughout the program period.

Amount of Subsidy
The subsidy amount for a given employee on eligible remuneration paid for the period between March 15 and June 6, 2020 would be the greater of:

75 per cent of the amount of remuneration paid, up to a maximum benefit of $847 per week; and
the amount of remuneration paid, up to a maximum benefit of $847 per week or 75 per cent of the employee’s pre-crisis weekly remuneration, whichever is less.
In effect, employers may be eligible for a subsidy of up to 100 per cent of the first 75 per cent of pre-crisis wages or salaries of existing employees. These employers would be expected where possible to maintain existing employees’ pre-crisis employment earnings. 

The pre-crisis remuneration for a given employee would be based on the average weekly remuneration paid between January 1 and March 15 inclusively, excluding any seven-day periods in respect of which the employee did not receive remuneration.

Employers will also be eligible for a subsidy of up to 75 per cent of salaries and wages paid to new employees.

Eligible remuneration may include salary, wages, and other remuneration like taxable benefits. These are amounts for which employers would generally be required to withhold or deduct amounts to remit to the Receiver General on account of the employee’s income tax obligation. However, it does not include severance pay, or items such as stock option benefits or the personal use of a corporate vehicle.

A special rule will apply to employees that do not deal at arm’s length with the employer. The subsidy amount for such employees will be limited to the eligible remuneration paid in any pay period between March 15 and June 6, 2020, up to a maximum benefit of the lesser of $847 per week and 75 per cent of the employee’s pre-crisis weekly remuneration. The subsidy would only be available in respect of non-arm’s length employees employed prior to March 15, 2020.

There would be no overall limit on the subsidy amount that an eligible employer may claim.

Employers are expected to make their best effort to top-up employees’ salaries to bring them to pre-crisis levels.

Refund for Certain Payroll Contributions
Today, the Government is proposing to expand the CEWS by introducing a new 100 per cent refund for certain employer-paid contributions to Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, and the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. This refund would cover 100 per cent of employer-paid contributions for eligible employees for each week throughout which those employees are on leave with pay and for which the employer is eligible to claim for the CEWS for those employees.  

In general, an employee will be considered to be on leave with pay throughout a week if that employee is remunerated by the employer for that week but does not perform any work for the employer in that week. This refund would not be available for eligible employees that are on leave with pay for only a portion of a week.

This refund would not be subject to the weekly maximum benefit per employee of $847 that an eligible employer may claim in respect of the CEWS. There would be no overall limit on the refund amount that an eligible employer may claim.

For greater certainty, employers would be required to continue to collect and remit employer and employee contributions to each program as usual. Eligible employers would apply for a refund, as described above, at the same time that they apply for the CEWS.

Eligible Periods
Eligibility would generally be determined by the change in an eligible employer’s monthly revenues, year-over-year, for the calendar month in which the period began.

Today, the government is announcing that all employers would be allowed to calculate their change in revenue using an alternative benchmark to determine their eligibility. This would provide more flexibility to employers for which the general approach may not be appropriate, including high-growth firms, sectors that faced difficulties in 2019, non-profits and charities, as well as employers established after February 2019. Under this alternative approach, employers would be allowed to compare their revenue using an average of their revenue earned in January and February 2020. Employers would select the general year-over-year approach or this alternative approach when first applying for the CEWS and would be required to use the same approach for the entire duration of the program

ABC Inc. is a start-up that started its operations last September.  It reported revenues of $100,000 in January and $140,000 in February, for a monthly average of $120,000. In March, its revenues dropped to $90,000. Because revenues in March are 25 per cent lower than $120,000, ABC inc. would be eligible for the CEWS for the first claiming period. To be eligible for the following claiming period, ABC Inc. revenues would have to be $84,000 or less for the month of April (that is, 30 per cent lower than $120,000).  
The amount of wage subsidy (provided under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan) received by the employer in a given month would be ignored for the purpose of measuring year-over-year changes in monthly revenues. 

For example, if revenues in March 2020 were down 20 per cent compared to March 2019, the employer would be allowed to claim the CEWS (as calculated above) on remuneration paid between March 15 and April 11, 2020. 
Alternatively, this employer could use its average revenue from the months of January and February 2020, instead of March 2019, to determine if it is eligible for the CEWS.
Once an approach is chosen, the employer would have to apply it throughout the program period. 
The table below outlines each claiming period, the required reduction in revenue and the reference period for eligibility.
Eligible Periods
 	Claiming period	Required reduction in revenue	Reference period for eligibility
Period 1	March 15
to
April 11	15%	March 2020 over:
March 2019 or
Average of January and February 2020
Period 2	April 12
to
May 9	30%	April 2020 over:
April 2019 or
Average of January and February 2020
Period 3	May 10
to
June 6	30%	May 2020 over:
May 2019 or
Average of January and February 2020
Eligible employees
An eligible employee is an individual who is employed in Canada.

Eligibility for the CEWS of an employee’s remuneration, will be limited to employees that have not been without remuneration for more than 14 consecutive days in the eligibility period, i.e., from March 15 to April 11, from April 12 to May 9, and from May 10 to June 6.

This rule replaces the previously announced restriction that an employer would not be eligible to claim the CEWS for remuneration paid to an employee in a week that falls within a 4-week period for which the employee is eligible for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit.

How to Apply
Eligible employers would be able to apply for the CEWS through the Canada Revenue Agency’s My Business Account portal as well as a web-based application. Employers would have to keep records demonstrating their reduction in arm’s-length revenues and remuneration paid to employees. More details about the application process will be made available shortly.

Ensuring Compliance
In order to maintain the integrity of the program and to ensure that it helps Canadians keep their jobs, the employer would be required to repay amounts paid under the CEWS if they do not meet the eligibility requirements. Penalties may apply in cases of fraudulent claims. The penalties may include fines or even imprisonment. In addition, anti-abuse rules would be put in place to ensure that the subsidy is not inappropriately obtained and to help ensure that employees are paid the amounts they are owed.  

Employers that engage in artificial transactions to reduce revenue for the purpose of claiming the CEWS would be subject to a penalty equal to 25 per cent of the value of the subsidy claimed, in addition to the requirement to repay in full the subsidy that was improperly claimed.

Interaction with 10 per cent Wage Subsidy
On March 25, 2020, the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act, which included the implementation of a temporary 10 per cent wage subsidy, received Royal Assent. For employers that are eligible for both the CEWS and the 10 per cent wage subsidy for a period, any benefit from the 10 per cent wage subsidy for remuneration paid in a specific period would generally reduce the amount available to be claimed under the CEWS in that same period.

Interaction with the Work-Sharing Program
On March 18, 2020, the Prime Minister announced an extension of the maximum duration of the Work-Sharing program from 38 weeks to 76 weeks for employers affected by COVID-19. This measure will provide income support to employees eligible for Employment Insurance who agree to reduce their normal working hours because of developments beyond the control of their employers.

For employers and employees that are participating in a Work-Sharing program, EI benefits received by employees through the Work-Sharing program will reduce the benefit that their employer is entitled to receive under the CEWS.

Government Assistance
The usual treatment of tax credits and other benefits provided by the government would apply. As a consequence, the wage subsidy received by an employer would be considered government assistance and be included in the employer’s taxable income.

Assistance received under either wage subsidy would reduce the amount of remuneration expenses eligible for other federal tax credits calculated on the same remuneration.

How employers will benefit from the CEWS
Maude and Stéphane own a corporation that operates an automobile repair shop in Saint Boniface, Manitoba. They are working full time, each drawing a salary of $1,300 per week, and have three part-time employees, each earning $800 per week, for a total weekly payroll of $5,000. Maude and Stéphane have reduced their opening hours due to decreased demand for their services. They had initially laid off their employees, but they have now decided to re-hire them following the announcement of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. Their employees are not being asked to report to work during this challenging period.

Maude and Stéphane are now keeping their employees on the payroll, paying them 75 per cent of their pre-crisis salary ($600 per week). Maude and Stéphane would be eligible for a weekly wage subsidy of $3,494 ($847 for each of themselves and $600 for each of their employees). Maude and Stéphane would also be eligible for a 100-per-cent refund of their employer-paid contributions to Employment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan in respect of their employees, providing an additional benefit of up to $124 per week.  

At the end of each claiming period, Maude and Stéphane would submit an application through the Canada Revenue Agency portal, attesting that their decline in revenues in each month is sufficient to qualify, when compared to the average of January and February. They would also report the total remuneration paid to themselves and their furloughed employees during the month. As Maude and Stéphane have access to direct deposits with the Canada Revenue Agency, they would receive their subsidy shortly after each application.",

The Government of Canada continues to take action to help Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Learn more about the latest measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.

The Government of Canada is taking strong, immediate and effective action to protect Canadians and the economy from the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. No Canadian should have to choose between protecting their health, putting food on the table, paying for their medication or caring for a family member.

To support workers and help businesses keep their employees, the government has proposed legislation to establish the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). This taxable benefit would provide $2,000 a month for up to four months for workers who lose their income as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CERB would be a simpler and more accessible combination of the previously announced Emergency Care Benefit and Emergency Support Benefit.

The CERB would cover Canadians who have lost their job, are sick, quarantined, or taking care of someone who is sick with COVID-19, as well as working parents who must stay home without pay to care for children who are sick or at home because of school and daycare closures. The CERB would apply to wage earners, as well as contract workers and self-employed individuals who would not otherwise be eligible for Employment Insurance (EI).

Additionally, workers who are still employed, but are not receiving income because of disruptions to their work situation due to COVID-19, would also qualify for the CERB. This would help businesses keep their employees as they navigate these difficult times, while ensuring they preserve the ability to quickly resume operations as soon as it becomes possible.

The EI system was not designed to process the unprecedented high volume of applications received in the past week. Given this situation, all Canadians who have ceased working due to COVID-19, whether they are EI-eligible or not, would be able to receive the CERB to ensure they have timely access to the income support they need.

Canadians who are already receiving EI regular and sickness benefits as of today would continue to receive their benefits and should not apply to the CERB. If their EI benefits end before October 3, 2020, they could apply for the CERB once their EI benefits cease, if they are unable to return to work due to COVID-19. Canadians who have already applied for EI and whose application has not yet been processed would not need to reapply. Canadians who are eligible for EI regular and sickness benefits would still be able to access their normal EI benefits, if still unemployed, after the 16-week period covered by the CERB.

The government is working to get money into the pockets of Canadians as quickly as possible. The portal for accessing the CERB would be available in early April. EI eligible Canadians who have lost their job can continue to apply for EI here, as can Canadians applying for other EI benefits.

Canadians would begin to receive their CERB payments within 10 days of application. The CERB would be paid every four weeks and be available from March 15, 2020 until October 3, 2020.

This benefit would be one part of the government’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, to support Canadian workers and businesses and help stabilize the economy by helping Canadians pay for essentials like housing and groceries, and helping businesses pay their employees and bills during this unprecedented time of global uncertainty.

Canadians can rest assured that the government stands ready to take any and all necessary actions as we continue to confront these challenging times together.”

Ensuring the safety and security of Canadians is the Government of Canada’s top priority. 

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a comprehensive $1 billion COVID-19 Response Fund in response to the pandemic. The Fund will help put in place the plans, infrastructure, and resources needed to protect the health and safety of all Canadians.

Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer has issued a formal health advisory, recommending that Canadians avoid going on cruise ships at this time. The health risk is for all the people touched by the cruise ship industry in Canada.

To further complement these measures, today the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Marc Garneau, announced the implementation of new measures pertaining to cruise ships in Canadian waters.

In 2019, Canada welcomed over 140 cruise ships that came to our shores directly from more than 10 different countries. The cruise industry brings at least 2 million travellers to our coasts annually.

As a response to COVID-19, the Government of Canada will defer the start of the cruise ship season in Canada, from April 2, 2020, to July 1, 2020, at the earliest. This deferral will apply to cruise ships capable of carrying more than 500 passengers and crew members.

Given the limited public health capacity in Canada’s Northern communities, the cruise ship season for vessels with Canadian Arctic stops will be deferred for the entire season this year. This would apply to cruise ships of all sizes.

While this measure does not apply to ferries or smaller vessels at this time, the Government of Canada is also developing an approach to ensure health measures are strengthened in all passenger vessels across Canada.

The Government of Canada recognizes that COVID-19 is having a major impact on the economy and communities across Canada. We are continually assessing the risks of the COVID-19 based on science and evidence, and consulting with our government, industry and regional health partners. Further decisions on whether the season can resume on July 1, 2020, will be based on science and evidence in the best interests of the health and safety of Canadians

The Government of Canada will continue to engage with the Tourism sector and regional partners to understand the effects of COVID-19 on local businesses and their employees.

These measures are part of a larger strategy the Government of Canada is implementing that prioritizes the health and safety of Canadians, ensures the capacity of the public health-care system, aligns Canada’s international and domestic approaches, and strives to mitigate the health and economic impacts in Canada.

Canadians who are planning to travel abroad are reminded to consult the Government of Canada’s Travel Advice and Advisories and register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service.

Quotes
“The safety and security of Canadians is a top priority. There is no immediate solution to allow cruise ships to operate in Canada while adequately containing the public health risk associated with COVID-19, other than delaying the start of the cruise ship season. We do not take these decisions lightly and will continue to reassess as the situation evolves.”

Minister of Transport
The Honourable Marc Garneau
“The health and safety of all Canadians—both those abroad and in Canada—is our top priority. With this delay in allowing cruise ships to dock in our ports, we can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.

The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced that Canada has issued an official global travel advisory to avoid non-essential travel abroad.

In an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), many governments have implemented special entry and exit and movement restrictions for their territories. New restrictions could be imposed, and could severely disrupt Canadians’ travel plans.

As a result, the Government of Canada is advising Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.

Canadians currently outside the country should find out what commercial options are still available and consider returning to Canada earlier than planned if these options are becoming more limited.

We encourage Canadians abroad to register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service.

Canadians abroad in need of emergency consular assistance can call Global Affairs Canada’s 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at +1 613-996-8885 (collect calls are accepted where available) or email sos@international.gc.ca.

The Government of Canada continues to take action to help Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Learn more about the latest measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. 

The health and welfare of all Canadians is a priority for the Government of Canada. The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has outlined Canada’s whole-of-government response to COVID-19 across the country, including new investments to respond in Canada and around the world.

Today, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau, Governor of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz, and Superintendent of Financial Institutions Jeremy Rudin outlined a coordinated package of measures being taken by financial sector partners to support the functioning of markets and continued access to financing for Canadian businesses.

At this time of global uncertainty, Canadians can be assured that the government is committed to addressing the challenges faced by individuals and businesses.

While Canada’s financial sector remains sound, well-capitalized and resilient, the government and its partners are taking action to ensure that Canadian families are safe, jobs are protected and the economy remains strong.

To support businesses during this extraordinary time, the government is establishing a Business Credit Availability Program (BCAP). The program will further support financing in the private sector through the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and Export Development Canada (EDC). Under this program, BDC and EDC will enhance their cooperation with private sector lenders to coordinate financing and credit insurance solutions for Canadian businesses.

This will allow BDC and EDC to provide more than $10 billion of additional support to businesses.

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) is lowering the Domestic Stability Buffer requirement for domestic systemically important banks by 1.25% of risk weighted assets, effective immediately. This action will increase the lending capacity of Canada’s large banks and support the supply of credit to the economy during the period of disruption related to COVID-19. The release of the buffer will support in excess of $300 billion of additional lending capacity.

The Bank of Canada is committed to providing sufficient liquidity to the Canadian financial system and to supporting business and consumer confidence.

Today, the Bank announced a new Bankers’ Acceptance Purchase Facility. This will support a key funding market for small- and medium-size businesses at a time when they may have increased funding needs and credit conditions are tightening.

On Thursday, the Bank announced it is broadening the scope of the Government of Canada bond buyback program to add market liquidity and support price discovery. The Bank also committed to proactively support interbank funding by temporarily adding new Term Repo operations with terms of 6 and 12 months, in addition to its regular 1-month and 3-month Term Repo operations.

In the coming weeks, the Bank of Canada will launch the Standing Term Liquidity Facility (STLF). Announced in November 2019, the STLF complements the Bank’s current tools for the provision of liquidity and will strengthen the Bank’s efforts to enhance the resilience of the Canadian financial system. Under the STLF, the Bank could provide loans to eligible financial institutions in need of temporary liquidity support and where the Bank has no concerns about their financial soundness.

Canadian financial institutions play an essential role in the stability and health of Canada’s financial system and economy. In the face of current global developments, financial institutions should focus on managing this uncertainty rather than devoting resources to previously announced regulatory changes.

OSFI also announced it will suspend all consultations on regulatory matters, including on the proposed new Benchmark Rate for the minimum qualifying rate for uninsured mortgages until conditions stabilize. As a result, the government is suspending the coming into force of the new Benchmark Rate for the minimum qualifying rate for insured mortgages until further notice.

In addition to actions by financial sector authorities, Minister Morneau has been in regular communication with the CEOs of Canada’s large banks, who have confirmed that government actions to support functioning markets will help maintain the flow of lending to Canadian business.

Canadian banks recognize the negative impact that COVID-19 may be having on some of their customers. They have made a commitment to the government that they will support businesses and individuals through these difficult times. Businesses that may be facing hardship are encouraged to contact their financial service providers early on.

The Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) today took steps to address the major impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the airline industry.

The Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR) set air carriers' obligations to passengers that vary depending on whether the situation is 'within the air carrier's control', 'within the air carrier's control but required for safety', or 'outside the air carrier's control'.

APPR also provide a list of situations considered 'outside the air carrier's control', including medical emergencies and orders or instructions from state officials. The CTA has identified a number of situations related to this pandemic that are considered 'outside of the air carrier's control'. These include flight disruptions to locations that are covered by a government advisory against travel or unnecessary travel due to COVID-19.

In these situations, air carriers would not be required to provide standards of treatment or compensation for inconvenience. However, they would have to make sure the passenger completes their itinerary.

Until April 30th, the time at which passengers will be entitled to compensation for inconvenience related to flight cancellations or delays will be adjusted, to provide air carriers with more flexibility to modify schedules and combine flights. Air carriers will be allowed to make schedule changes without owing compensation to passengers until 72 hours before a scheduled departure time (instead of 14 days), and air carriers will be obligated to compensate passengers for delays on arrival that are fully within the air carrier's control once those delays are 6 hours or more in length (instead of 3 hours).

The CTA has also exempted air carriers from offering alternative travel arrangements that include flights on other air carrier's with which they have no commercial agreement.

These measures recognize the extraordinary nature of the current situation. After April 30th, the CTA will decide whether these temporary measures should be extended for an additional period of time.

All other air passenger entitlements under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations remain in force and unchanged, including those related to communication, tarmac delays and seating of children.

Quote

""The CTA recognizes that this is a very challenging time for both airlines and air passengers. The temporary measures we've taken today strike a balance between, on the one hand, giving airlines the necessary flexibility to adjust schedules in the face of rapidly falling passenger numbers and very fluid circumstances and, on the other hand, making sure passengers are well-protected. We'll continue to monitor the situation closely.""

- Scott Streiner, Chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency

About the CTA

The Canadian Transportation Agency is an independent, quasi-judicial tribunal and regulator that has, with respect to all matters necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction, all the powers of a superior court. The CTA has three core mandates: helping to keep the national transportation system running efficiently and smoothly, protecting the fundamental right of persons with disabilities to accessible transportation services, and providing consumer protection for air passengers. To help advance these mandates, the CTA makes and enforces ground rules that establish the rights and responsibilities of transportation service providers and users and level the playing field among competitors, resolves disputes using a range of tools from facilitation and mediation to arbitration and adjudication, and ensures that transportation providers and users are aware of their rights and responsibilities and how the CTA can help them.",

The elderly man who died of COVID-19 on Sunday night lived at a North Vancouver nursing home where two workers and at least one other resident are also infected, making the facility the site of Canada’s first coronavirus outbreak.

Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu called the death, “deeply saddening,” and said the federal government is preparing to provide the equipment and money needed to fight the virus, which has infected about 115,000 people and killed more than 4,000 worldwide.

Canada reported 77 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, as of Monday night, up from 66 the day before.

As British Columbia officials worked to contain the nursing-home outbreak, other Canadians fought the virus on multiple fronts: Contact tracers rushed to identify people who might have been exposed to passengers on virus-riddled cruise ships; a member of Parliament and a Toronto city councillor isolated themselves because of possible coronavirus exposure linked to a Washington conference; and Quebec announced it would open three dedicated clinics to handle the expected onslaught of requests for coronavirus testing and care.

The Public Health Agency of Canada, meanwhile, officially advised Canadians to avoid cruise ships, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland sent a letter asking all premiers to flag any gaps in their preparedness.

“We are already leading a bulk procurement of personal protective equipment in which many of you are participating,” the letter said. “We are ready to convene and help.”

Still, political and public-health leaders said there was no need – yet – for Canada to close schools, cancel mass gatherings or restrict out-of-country travel, even as March break looms.

“These things have implications,” Barbara Yaffe, Ontario’s associate chief medical officer of health, said of scrapping large events. “So it’s something that needs to be discussed for each mass gathering, and hopefully we won’t get to that point.” Experts are divided on whether and when Canada should take the kinds of extreme measures that have paralyzed much of China, where the virus first emerged, and northern Italy, the site of the deadliest outbreak outside China. Italy extended strict quarantine measures to the whole country Monday.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, has said that countries where the virus has spread in the community should contemplate the most serious cancellations and restrictions.

“The threat of a pandemic has become very real,” Dr. Tedros said Monday.

Canada is aware of some local transmission of the coronavirus, but so far it is limited to the outbreak at B.C.'s Lynn Valley Care Centre.

On Saturday, B.C. revealed that its first confirmed instance of community spread – that is, a confirmed case with no recent travel history or clear links to other cases – is a health-care worker at the care home.

On Monday, Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, said it is becoming apparent that this person, a woman in her 50s, was exposed to the virus at work, and did not bring it into the facility. The woman recently worked at two other health-care facilities, Dr. Henry added.

“What we do know is that, very likely, both health-care workers and both residents that we know of now, were infected from someone else within that setting,” Dr. Henry said. “The investigation is going on to determine exactly who, and how that happened.”

Janine McCready, an infectious diseases physician at Toronto’s Michael Garron Hospital, said that in order to avoid the type of uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19 seen in countries such as Italy and Iran, Canada needs to move forward with plans to cancel large gatherings, such as sporting events, as well as the closing of schools.

“The sooner we do [those measures], the more effective they’re going to be,” Dr. McCready said. “We want to be like Singapore or Hong Kong, not like Italy or Iran or even Seattle.""

However, Susy Hota, medical director of infection prevention and control at Toronto’s University Health Network, said Canada is at a critical “in between” moment, with cases ramping up but only one confirmed case of local human-to-human transmission, in B.C.

""Closing schools, at this point in my mind, doesn’t make sense,” Dr. Hota said. “We don’t have [much] community spread and it’s not really clear what the role is of schools in spreading this, to be honest.”

David Fisman, head of the epidemiology division at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said he was particularly worried about what would happen after thousands of Canadians returned from spring break abroad.

He said he feared that limited testing could be masking a “massive uncontrolled epidemic” in a favourite destination for Canadians: the United States.

""March break represents a tremendous risk to Canadians,” Dr. Fisman said. “It’s sort of like a big anti-vaxxer-measles party, but with COVID and Canadian tourists.”",

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the Government of Canada has been working with provinces, territories, and international partners to protect the health and well-being of Canadians. As more countries begin to deal with COVID-19 outbreaks, the Government of Canada is investing in Canadian researchers to learn more about this novel coronavirus and to develop tools and resources to combat it.   

To further contribute to global efforts to address the COVID-19 outbreak, today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Canada’s Minister of Health, and the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, announced an investment of nearly $27 million to fund coronavirus research. Due to the overwhelming response to the call for research applications, the Government of Canada increased its original investment from $7 million to $27 million. This investment will support 47 research teams from across Canada that will focus on accelerating the development, testing, and implementation of measures to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. The Ministers made the announcement with the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, and the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, President of the Treasury Board.

The research will help inform clinical and public health responses, develop and evaluate diagnostic tools and vaccines, as well as create strategies to tackle misinformation, stigma, and fear. The Government of Canada is providing the funding for this research through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Canada Research Coordinating Committee (CRCC) through the New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF), the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and Genome Canada (GC).

The Government of Canada is taking strong, immediate and effective action to protect Canadians and our economy from the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The air transportation sector has been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As governments around the world impose border restrictions and advise their citizens against non-essential travel to protect people’s health, the sector has faced significant declines in air passenger traffic, staff layoffs, and grounding of planes.

Today, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced that the government is waiving ground lease rents from March 2020 through to December 2020 for the 21 airport authorities that pay rent to the federal government. The government will also provide comparable treatment for PortsToronto, which operates Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and pays a charge to the federal government. This support will help airports reduce cost pressures and preserve their cash flow as they deal with the effects of COVID-19 on their revenue streams. This will provide relief up to $331.4 million, reflecting payments in the same period of 2018.

These measures are part of the Government of Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan - a comprehensive plan to help ensure that Canadians can pay for essentials like mortgages, rent and groceries, and to help businesses continue to pay their employees and their bills during this time of uncertainty.

The government continues to assess and respond to the impact of COVID-19, and stands ready to take additional actions as needed to stabilize the economy and mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.

“We recognize the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on people and the economy, and that certain sectors, such as the air transportation industry, have suffered tremendously. As we have said since this crisis began, we have Canadians’ backs and stand ready to do anything and everything in our power to support those who are suffering. The support provided today is the next step in Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan to help workers and businesses get through this unprecedented time of turmoil.”

Bill Morneau, Minister of Finance
“From March to December 2020, the Government of Canada intends to waive rent for the  21 National Airport System airport authorities, and will provide comparable support to Billy Bishop airport.  We want to provide relief for these important entities who are still open under difficult circumstances, and are helping to help bring Canadians home.  We are appreciative that they continue to support the flow of people and goods during this challenging time.”

Marc Garneau, Minister of Transport

The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, and the Honourable Harjit Sajjan, Minister of National Defence, today announced that the Government of Canada has chartered a plane to repatriate Canadians on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan.

This decision was taken because of the extraordinary circumstances faced by passengers on the Diamond Princess and to lighten the burden on the Japanese health-care system. We are working closely with Carnival Cruise Lines and the Government of Japan to assist in this evacuation.

The aircraft will bring passengers from Japan to Canadian Forces Base Trenton, after which they will be assessed and transported to the NAV Canada Training Institute in Cornwall, Ontario, to undergo a further 14-day period of quarantine.

Before boarding in Japan, passengers will be screened for symptoms. Those who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 will not be permitted to board and will instead be transferred to the Japanese health system to receive appropriate care.

Those who remain in Japan will continue to receive full consular services from the Government of Canada.

In addition to experts from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Armed Forces medical personnel, four members of the Standing Rapid Deployment Team (SRDT) are on the ground in Tokyo to assist Canadians during this difficult time.

We will continue to provide more information on travel plans for returning to Canada as it becomes available. In the meantime, we ask all Canadians aboard the Diamond Princess to continue to follow recommendations for protecting their health and the health of others while under Japanese quarantine.

Canadians in countries affected by COVID-19 are encouraged to sign up with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service to receive the latest updates from the Government of Canada.

Canadians can also contact Global Affairs Canada’s 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at +1 613 996 8885 or email sos@international.gc.ca.

The Government of Canada has been working closely with provincial and territorial counterparts, and international partners, since China first reported 2019-nCoV cases to ensure that our country is prepared to limit the spread of 2019-nCoV in Canada.

Measures to mitigate the risk of introduction and spread of diseases like the new coronavirus in Canada are in place, including messaging on arrival screens at the Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms, and an additional health screening question on electronic kiosks used by international travellers.

While the risk of an outbreak of novel coronavirus in Canada remains low, I encourage Canadians to tell your health care professional if you have travelled to an affected area of China, and develop flu-like symptoms.
