Premier Doug Ford Commemorates Yom HaShoah

Office of the Premier


Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to mark Yom HaShoah:
""At sundown, the people of Ontario and the Jewish community across the province and around the world will remember one of the darkest periods in human history. Yom HaShoah commemorates the lives and heroism of Jewish people who were brutally murdered by the Nazi regime during the Second World War. We must never forget the millions of women, children and men who lost their lives in the Holocaust. What took place during the Holocaust must never be repeated. We remember not only the atrocities, but also the many heroes and survivors, so that we can learn from the past and educate future generations. As survivors age, we must renew our commitment to remember the past and to vigilantly keep the promise - never again. We recognize the many contributions of the Jewish community to our province, while renewing our commitment to fight anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms. I want to thank MPPs Will Bouma and Robin Martin for leading a private members' bill to officially adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism. We are stronger when we stand together. Ontario will always promote a society that respects diversity and freedom.""

Health Experts Say the COVID-19 Outbreak Has Likely Peaked in Ontario 
Modelling shows physical distancing still needed to prevent further spread

April 20, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government today released updated COVID-19 modelling, which shows that the enhanced public health measures, including staying home and physically distancing from each other, are working to contain the spread of the virus and flatten the curve. However, the Chief Medical Officer of Health says emergency measures must remain in place to continue reducing the number of cases and deaths.
""The modelling clearly demonstrates that we are making progress in our fight against this deadly virus. That's due to the actions of all Ontarians, those who are staying home and practising physical distancing, and to the heroic efforts of our frontline health care workers,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""But COVID-19 continues to be a clear and present danger, especially to our seniors and most vulnerable citizens. That is why we must continue to follow the advice of our Chief Medical Officer of Health and stay the course in order to keep people safe and healthy."" Key highlights from the modelling update include: The wave of new community spread cases of COVID-19 in Ontario appears to have peaked.Outbreaks in long-term care and congregate settings continue to be a major concern. Concerted actions are underway to protect vulnerable people in these settings.Ontario is now trending toward a best case scenario rather than a worst case scenario and has significantly improved its standing as compared to March modelling.The province has avoided a significant surge in cases. Total cumulative cases are forecast to be substantially lower than worst case or even moderate case scenarios projected by previous models.While several hundred new cases are identified daily in Ontario, hospitals across the province have not been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 outbreak as a result of capacity planning and the public health measures currently in place. The rate of growth day-over-day is declining.To further reduce the number of cases and deaths, it remains critical that Ontarians continue to adhere to public health measures, including staying home and practicing physical distancing if they must go out for essential reasons only.""The information released today shows early but unmistakable signs that our efforts are working,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""These numbers are not an accident. They are the result of months of planning and collective action to stop the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the curve. However, in order for these projections to become reality, each of us must continue to stay home as much possible and practise physical distancing."" To enhance protections for residents and staff in long-term care homes, last week Ontario launched the COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes. This action plan will ensure the implementation of critical new measures to prevent further outbreaks and deaths from COVID-19 in long-term care homes. These measures include enhancing and expanding testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases; providing public health and infection control expertise; and redeploying staff from hospitals and home and community care to support the long-term care home workforce. ""The new province-wide modelling data are encouraging, but we know that long-term care homes and other congregate settings will track on a different path,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""We will continue to take aggressive action to support our most vulnerable residents and their caregivers.""

Quick Facts

All Ontarians need to stay home unless absolutely necessary for essential trips, such as accessing health care services, groceries, picking up prescriptions or supporting vulnerable community members with meeting essential needs. If you must leave your home, go alone and stay at least two metres apart from others.
Ontario has made improvements to its COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool by expanding its symptom list, addressing the most high risk individuals, and making it more accessible and responsive. 
Take these everyday steps to reduce exposure to COVID-19 and protect your health: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer; sneeze and cough into your sleeve; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth; avoid contact with people who are sick; stay home if you are sick.

On November 12, 2019, conservation officers from the Bancroft Enforcement Unit located evidence of recent deer hunting activity while conducting a patrol in Carlow Township of Hastings County. An investigation determined that earlier that day two men had harvested two deer near Hass Road, and that both men discharged their firearm across the road. On March 3, 2020, both men pleaded guilty to charges under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Actin Bancroft Provincial Offences Court, before Justice of the Peace Ernest Parsons. Brandon Bellis of Foxboro was fined $3,000 for discharging a firearm without reasonable consideration for people or property and $500 for possessing illegally killed wildlife. He also received a one-year hunting suspension and must successfully retake the Ontario Hunter Education Course before he can hunt again. Eric Mclennan of Campbellford was fined $3,000 for discharging a firearm without reasonable consideration for people or property and $500 for possessing illegally killed wildlife. He also received a one-year hunting suspension and must successfully retake the Ontario Hunter Education Course before he can hunt again. The seized deer was donated to a local charity. Conservation officers continue to patrol and protect our natural resources during the COVID-19 outbreak and would like to remind everyone that by respecting seasons, sanctuaries, bag and possession limits we all help ensure our natural resources stay healthy.

These employers have to comply with all provincial orders, as well as any guidance and safety standards prescribed by the Ontario government for COVID-19. They are also responsible for ensuring that any staff reassigned to the new duties have the required training and skills. ""During this critical time, our local delivery partners need the flexibility to be able to respond quickly and effectively to maintain essential frontline services,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""We will continue to face these challenges together as we work to protect the health and safety of all Ontarians.""

Ontario Enables Auto Insurance Companies to Provide Driver Rebates During COVID-19 
Regulatory Changes Open the Door for Auto Insurance Rebates

April 16, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — The Ontario government is enabling auto insurance companies to provide temporary insurance premium rebates to drivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The province has amended a regulation under the Insurance Act to help ease the financial pressure on working people and families during this public health crisis.
By amending this regulation insurance companies would be able to provide auto insurance premium rebates to consumers for up to 12 months after the declared emergency has ended.  ""We are in an unprecedented time and people are experiencing extraordinary financial pressures,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""My message to insurance companies has been clear: they should provide relief that reflects the financial hardships their dedicated customers are facing due to the COVID-19 outbreak."" ""All of us will remember how companies treat us during these unprecedented times. I often remind business leaders that their customers from the past five years are likely to be their customers for the next five years,"" said Phillips. ""Insurance companies indicated that the regulation preventing rebates was a barrier to providing relief to their customers. That barrier has now been removed so auto insurance companies can step up and do the right thing for the people and families of Ontario."" The Government and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA) will continue to work together to monitor how the auto insurance sector is responding. 

Quick Facts

Ontario is the first jurisdiction in Canada to remove existing restrictions on rebating so auto insurers can provide additional consumer relief. 
The rebating prohibition is designed to protect consumers from being misled in purchasing decisions based on a rebate and to provide consumer protection from insurers who may discriminate between consumers.

Ontario Significantly Expands Hospital Capacity to Prepare for Any COVID-19 Outbreak Scenario 
Province adds more than 2,000 acute care and critical care beds and enacts pandemic staffing plans

April 16, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Acting on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other health care professionals, the Ontario government has significantly expanded hospital capacity in preparation for any COVID-19 outbreak scenario. The province has added 1,035 acute care beds and 1,492 critical care beds and taken steps to ensure hospitals have the staff available to care for a sudden surge in patients.
""Thanks to the hard work and relentless preparation of our hospital staff to build capacity in our hospitals, we are in a position to better allocate resources to sectors that are in critical need and respond to any potential surge in cases,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""When you combine these life-saving beds with the very best care delivered by our highly skilled hospital staff, our patients will definitely have a fighting chance against this deadly virus."" Hospitals across the province have taken steps to make more beds available for COVID-19 patients in every region of the province. As a result, Ontario has a total of 20,354 acute care beds with a potential for an additional 4,205 more acute care beds by April 30, 2020. Of Ontario's 3,504 critical care beds, 2,811 are now equipped with ventilators, up from 1,319 when the outbreak first started. ""As we've said from the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, Ontario will be prepared to respond to any outbreak scenario, including having plans in place for the worst-case scenario,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Heath. ""Thanks to the innovative work by our health care leaders, we have been able to significantly expand acute and critical care capacity in Ontario's hospitals. While these are positive steps forward, it remains as important as ever that everyone continues to help stop the spread by staying home unless you are an essential service worker."" This bed capacity expansion has been organized in coordination with pandemic staffing plans to ensure each hospital has the physicians and staff needed, including in case of a major surge of cases. Measures include: Redeploying surgical nursing staff who can now work with medicine units;Sharing highly trained emergency department and intensive care unit nursing staffs across units;Sharing physician resources across hospitals in a given region;Recruiting family doctors to complete shifts within the hospital; andRecruiting retirees, including nursing and support services.The province continues to focus on what resources will be needed to further enhance capacity quickly, if the need arises. Hospitals have identified additional opportunities to add new beds, including through the use of field hospitals, conference centres, school locations and more. Sites are ready to open based on the needs of the community.

Quick Facts

Ontario’s hospitals activated their pandemic plans to guide their decisions on how they created the enhanced capacity, including postponing some elective surgeries and reorganizing the discharging of alternate level of care patient to appropriate locations.

Several other measures, including the launch of Ontario’s online self-assessment tool, opening assessment centres, increasing Telehealth capacity and the ability to consult with emergency department doctors virtually have also helped to reduce emergency room visits and hospital admissions.
As of April 13, 2020, the average hospital occupancy rate was 69.1%% (64.1% for acute care only), a significant decrease from 96.2% (97.3% for acute beds) before COVID-19 measures. There are over 7,300 acute care beds unoccupied and over 2,000 critical care beds currently available across Ontario.
Ontario recently placed an order with O-Two Medical Technologies to produce 10,000 ventilator units, along with the support of Ontario's world-class manufacturing sector.

Robust action plan and new emergency order to protect the most vulnerable in long-term care homes

April 15, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — In order to better protect the most vulnerable and stop the spread of COVID-19 in long-term care homes, the Ontario government has developed a robust action plan with key measures to be implemented within hours. In addition, the province has issued a new emergency order restricting long-term care staff from working in more than one long-term care home, retirement home or health care setting. These measures are being taken on the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health.
The COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes was announced today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""We will do everything we can to protect our seniors and most vulnerable citizens because we all know they are most at risk during this pandemic,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our three-point action plan builds on the measures we have already taken to fortify that iron ring of protection we have placed around our long-term care residents and those who care for them.""  The COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes adds critical new measures to prevent further outbreaks and deaths from COVID-19 in long-term care homes, including:    Aggressive Testing, Screening, and Surveillance: enhancing testing for symptomatic residents and staff and those who have been in contact with persons confirmed to have COVID-19; expanding screening to include more asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases; and leveraging surveillance tools to enable care providers to move proactively against the disease.Managing Outbreaks and Spread of the Disease: supporting long-term care homes with public health and infection control expertise to contain and prevent outbreaks; providing additional training and support for current staff working in outbreak conditions.Growing our Heroic Long-Term Care Workforce: redeploying staff from hospitals and home and community care to support the long-term care home workforce and respond to outbreaks, alongside intensive on-going recruitment initiatives.Additional measures under development will help to ensure preparedness and respond to the situation as it evolves, including improving isolation capacity at long-term care homes. Within less than 48 hours, the government will immediately act to deliver: enhanced testing and surveillance for symptomatic residents and staff and those in contact with persons confirmed to have COVID-19;testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in select homes across the province to better understand how COVID-19 is spreading;risk and capacity assessments for all homes;working with Ontario Health, the Ontario Hospital Association, and public health units to assemble infection control and preventions teams and additional supports;enhanced guidance on personal protective equipment and continued priority distribution to homes;enhanced training and education to support staff working in outbreak situations; andredeploying hospital and home care resources into homes.""We must continue to act to stop the spread of this virus in our long-term care homes,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and well-being of our loved ones in long-term care, or the front-line heroes who care for them."" ""This new action plan significantly enhances existing efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect our most vulnerable, including long-term care home residents and the staff who care for them,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Having significantly expanded the scope and scale of testing and made considerable progress in securing personal protective equipment, Ontario has never been better positioned to deliver on our commitment to support long-term care homes in our shared battle against this virus."" The government has also issued an emergency order directing long-term care employers to ensure their employees, including registered nurses, registered practical nurses, personal support workers, kitchen and cleaning staff only work in one long-term care home. This means that employees cannot work in multiple locations such as a retirement home or other health care setting. As a result of this order, long-term care workers who must temporarily give up a job in another care setting are protected from losing their job as they are entitled to an unpaid leave of absence. To help long-term care workers make up these lost wages, the government encourages long-term care employers to offer full-time hours to their part-time employees during the COVID-19 outbreak. To help employers cover this expense, the government is taking action to ensure long-term care homes have the flexibility and funds to rapidly hire nurses and other front-line staff they need, when they need them. These emergency funds are available to help long-term care homes cover the incremental costs of increasing hours for part-time staff to help those staff limit their work locations. All long-term care staff continue to be subject to rigorous screening procedures and must follow personal protective equipment guidelines, including wearing surgical masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection while in homes.

Quick Facts

The COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes will continue to evolve in response to COVID-19. The government is actively seeking and acting on proposals to fight this virus through the Ontario Together portal. 
The temporary emergency order will come into effect on April 22, 2020 in order to give long-term care homes enough time to be compliant with the order. It builds on previous emergency orders issued March 24 and March 28, 2020.
An investment of $243 million in COVID-19 emergency funding is available to homes to cover the costs associated with securing the staffing, supplies, and capacity they need at this unprecedented time.
To help understaffed long-term care homes find qualified staff, the government launched an online tool to help match skilled front-line workers with employers: the Health Workforce Matching Portal.

Ontario Extends Declaration of Emergency to Continue the Fight Against COVID-19
Sustained Measures Necessary to Stop the Spread and Protect Public Health

April 14, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and with the approval of the Ontario legislature, the Ontario government is extending the Declaration of Emergency under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act for a further 28 days. This will allow the government to continue to use every tool at its disposal to protect the health and safety of the people of Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Passed during a special sitting of the Ontario legislature and with the full cooperation of all parties, the Declaration of Emergency has been extended until May 12. The extension of the provincial declaration of emergency allows Ontario to continue to enforce current emergency orders, such as the closure of all non-essential workplaces, outdoor amenities such as parks and recreational areas, public places and bars and restaurants, as well as restrictions on social gatherings of more than five people, and prohibitions against price-gouging. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. ""During these unprecedented times, we cannot let our guard down. The actions being taken by everyone to stay home and practice physical distancing are making a difference, but we are not out of the woods yet,"" said Premier Ford. ""With the support of every Ontario MPP, we continue to take any and all actions necessary to support our frontline health care workers and respond rapidly and decisively to slow the spread of this deadly virus."" The legislature also passed the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Support and Protection Act to amend the Education Act, Planning Act, Development Charges Act, Police Services Act and the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act. This new legislation demonstrates that the government is actively listening to the concerns of education and municipal stakeholders during this COVID-19 emergency. ""This legislation is about protecting the health and economic interests of Ontarians,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""We will do whatever it takes to get through this challenge ― most especially for the next generation ― so that students continue learning and graduating."" The amendments to the Education Act will allow school boards to continue charging fees on new construction in order to retain a vital source of revenue for new school projects. The bill also includes an amendment to provide a fair and consistent provincewide approach to addressing school suspensions and expulsions as part of the government's commitment to the safety of students and staff upon the reopening of schools. The changes to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act will temporarily suspend student loan payments for OSAP borrowers and initiate a six-month interest-free moratorium on OSAP loans. ""We are taking action to ease the financial burden for students and current borrowers during the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. ""By temporarily suspending loan repayments and interest accrual, our government is providing immediate support for OSAP borrowers during these challenging times.""   The government is making it possible to suspend certain municipal planning decision timelines during the state of emergency, and change the Development Charges Act to ensure municipalities can continue to count on a vital source of revenue that helps pay for local growth-related infrastructure, such as roads, water and sewers as well as fire and police services. The amendments to the Police Services Act also allow the Solicitor General to give municipalities an extension beyond January 1, 2021 to prepare and adopt a community safety and well-being plan. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and well-being of all individuals and families,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""We have listened to our municipal partners and made these changes to help them better manage staff time and resources so they can focus on the COVID-19 outbreak."" ""In these unprecedented times, our government is doing everything in its power to support our municipal, policing and community partners,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""While Community Safety and Well-Being Plans are an important tool for municipalities to keep our communities safe, we need them to focus on allocating resources where they are needed most right now, and that is to stop the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Secures Critical Medical Equipment and Supplies
Same-Day Deliveries Made to Protect Patients and Frontline Workers from COVID-19

April 13, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government continues to ensure that patients, frontline health care workers and first responders have the critical equipment and supplies they need to protect themselves during the COVID-19 outbreak. Over the last five days, more than 13 million surgical and procedural masks, 200,000 N95 respirator masks, and 38 ventilators have been delivered to Ontario's pandemic stockpile warehouses.  
""The global competition to secure critical personal protective equipment and medical supplies is fierce, yet our team of procurement specialists continues to locate the masks, gloves and ventilators we need to keep our frontline workers and patients safe,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""I also want to take this opportunity to thank Premier Jason Kenney and the people of Alberta for making a generous donation of critical medical supplies and equipment in the fight against COVID-19. By standing united in adversity, Team Canada will stop this virus in its tracks."" Ontario is providing same-day deliveries to hospitals, long-term care and retirement homes, and other facilities to support essential workers in all settings and ensuring supplies and equipment are expedited to those most in need. This includes shipments this past weekend of 6.5 million surgical and procedural masks to over 650 providers across the province to protect our frontline workers, patients and residents. ""I am pleased to report that we continue making significant progress in securing the necessary personal protective equipment needed to effectively respond to COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and safety of patients and the workers caring for them, as well as our first responders. We will continue working around the clock to add to the provincial stockpile to ensure that we are equipped to support those fighting this outbreak on the frontlines."" Ontario has been procuring vital supplies and personal protective equipment through its traditional suppliers and donations, as well as working in collaboration with the federal government, other provinces, and Ontario's manufacturers. On Saturday, Alberta committed to send Ontario 250,000 N95 masks, 2.5 million surgical masks, 15 million surgical gloves, 87,000 safety goggles, and 50 ventilators.  While Ontario is making progress in procuring critical supplies and equipment, the global supply chain remains constrained. Conservation of supplies and equipment, particularly personal protective equipment is of utmost importance. The government is working to ensure those in priority areas and in urgent need are receiving the supplies they need.

Quick Facts

Ontario obtains its own supplies and receives others procured centrally by the federal government. 
As of April 13, through the Ontario Together web portal, the province has received over 14,500 submissions from businesses and private citizens, offering to provide or donate various supplies and equipment, such as masks, face shields, testing equipment, ventilators, hand sanitizer, gowns and coveralls. More than 9,000 emergency supply submissions have generated nearly $90 million in purchases of critical equipment and supplies. 
Ontario has launched a new $50 million Ontario Together Fund to help businesses provide innovative solutions or retool their operations to manufacture essential medical supplies and equipment, including gowns, coveralls, masks, face shields, testing equipment and ventilators
Ontario is making it easier for businesses to work with government by developing a smarter procurement system that will save taxpayer money, drive office efficiencies and help small- and medium-sized businesses tap into new opportunities in government procurement.

Province Developing New Health Data Platform to Help Defeat COVID-19
New platform will allow researchers to better detect, plan and respond to the outbreak

April 12, 2020  4:02 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO —The Ontario government is taking steps to better detect, plan and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. In consultation with the Ontario Privacy Commissioner, the province is developing a new health data platform called the Pandemic Threat Response (PANTHR). This new platform will hold secure health data that will allow researchers to better support health system planning and responsiveness, including the immediate need to analyze the current COVID-19 outbreak.
""Better access to integrated data will improve modelling and research to determine how COVID-19 is evolving, ensuring frontline staff are as prepared as possible in these unprecedented times,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While access to data is important, we are taking all measures to ensure patient privacy is always respected and Ontarians are aware of how anonymized information may be shared."" Ontario will appoint a PANTHR special advisor and form a roundtable to provide recommendations about the data and policies to support and help overcome barriers while developing this platform. The information gathered in the secure platform will help break down long-standing barriers and allow researchers to help with: Increasing detection of COVID-19;Discovering risk factors for vulnerable populations;Predicting when and where outbreaks may happen;Evaluating how preventative and treatment measures are working; andIdentifying where to allocate equipment and other resources. ""Integrating data from across the province will allow us to effectively leverage tools, like artificial intelligence, to better understand this virus, how it spreads and the most effective means of combatting it,"" said Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board. ""These key insights will mean our world-class health system partners have secure access to better and more consistent population data, improving decision-making in health care and aiding our efforts to beat COVID-19. The health and safety of Ontarians remains our singular focus - this is another measure that will allow us to continue to deliver on that commitment.""  When launched, PANTHR will provide access to de-identified, integrated data on publicly funded administrative health services records, including: Physician claims submitted to the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP);Medical drug claims submitted to the Ontario Drug Benefit Program;Discharge summaries of hospital stays and emergency department visits; andClaims for home care and long-term care. PANTHR will also contain clinical data from special registry collections, such as the Critical Care Information System (CCIS), which reports on critical care capacity in the province, and clinical data extracted from public health, hospital, laboratory and diagnostic imaging information systems. Other supporting data may also be added based on needs of researchers in achieving COVID-19 objectives.

""Today, people across Ontario will celebrate the joyous occasion of Easter. For Christians, Easter Sunday is the holiest day in the Christian calendar and marks the triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ. For others, the Easter long weekend is a time to celebrate the arrival of spring, spend quality time with family, and exchange gifts such as chocolates and sweets with loved ones. This year, Easter celebrations will be different due to the pandemic. All but essential workers will need to stay home and practise physical distancing in order to help keep everyone safe and healthy. However, we can still enjoy a meal with those in our household and connect with loved ones by phone, email or videochat. Please think of our seniors and those facing hard times, and consider reaching out or dropping off necessities for them. For the kids worried about whether the Easter Bunny will come this year, don't worry. Earlier this week, I declared the Easter Bunny's delivery of chocolates and candy an essential service. The Easter Bunny will still be hopping about, while following the rules of physical distancing and avoiding public areas to keep us all protected and ensuring everyone can enjoy this special time. From my family to yours, I want to wish everyone a safe and healthy holiday at home. Happy Easter!""

Ontario Takes Further Action to Stop the Spread of COVID-19 
Province Extends Emergency Orders until April 23

April 11, 2020  8:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — To help stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of people across the province, the Ontario government has extended all emergency orders that have been put in place to-date under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act until April 23, 2020, including the closure of outdoor amenities in parks and recreational areas, non-essential workplaces, public places and bars and restaurants, along with restrictions on social gatherings and the prohibition of price gouging.
In addition, new measures have been introduced to address surge capacity in retirement homes, restrict recreational camping on Crown land, and allow the repurposing of existing buildings and temporary structures. All of these actions are based on the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health. ""I understand the actions we are taking are affecting the lives and livelihoods of people across the province, but these are extraordinary times and we need to do whatever we can to keep individuals and families safe and stop the spread of this terrible virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""We all must continue to do our part by staying home and practicing physical distancing. With the proper precautions and additional measures we're taking today, I am confident we will get through this together and stronger."" Ontario introduced the following new steps to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The government is: Making it easier to repurpose existing buildings and put up temporary structures, like tents, so communities can meet their local needs quickly. This will reduce pressure on health care facilities, where needed, and help shelters provide more space for sleeping to maintain the physical distancing requirements to reduce the spread of the virus.Temporarily enabling hospitals to increase their capacity by using the beds and services of retirement homes without certain labour relations implications during the declared provincial emergency.Prohibiting recreational camping on Crown land as of April 9, 2020. Under the emergency order, no individual can camp on Crown land, including the placement of tents or other camping structures, while the order is in effect. The government will continue to monitor the situation and re-evaluate if further actions are required.Supporting construction workers and businesses with emergency action to help improve cash flow in the construction industry during the COVID-19 outbreak. This will lift the suspension of limitation periods and procedural time periods under the Construction Act and allow the release of holdback payments to contractors and subcontractors.The following emergency orders have been extended until April 23, 2020: Closure of public places and establishments with exemption for emergency child care for health care and frontline essential service workersProhibiting events and gatherings of more than five peopleWork deployment for health service providersDrinking water and sewageElectronic service of documentsWork deployment for long-term care homesElectricity pricingClosure of non-essential workplacesTraffic managementStreamlining requirements for long-term care homesProhibiting unfair pricing for necessary goodsEnforcement of ordersWork deployment for boards of healthWork deployment measures in retirement homesAccess to COVID-19 status information by specified personsService agencies providing services and supports to adults with developmental disabilitiesPick up and delivery of cannabisSignatures in wills and powers of attorneyUse of force and firearms in policing servicesClosure of outdoor recreational amenities"

Province Prevents Operators from Charging Fees while Child Cares are Closed

April 10, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ontario government is temporarily preventing child care centres from collecting payments from parents, while also ensuring that their child care spaces are protected. Child care centres, with the exception of those accommodating health care and other frontline workers, were ordered closed to help prevent the spread of the virus and keep the children and child care staff safe.  
An emergency order has been issued, and immediately prevents any child care operator from charging parent fees where care is not being provided. The order also means that parents cannot lose their child care space because they are not paying fees during this period. This will help provide much needed relief for parents during the outbreak. ""COVID-19 has imposed significant financial pressure on working parents,"" said Stephen Lecce, Education Minister. ""We need to support our parents who may be facing reduced income or layoffs during the COVID-19 outbreak."" The child care sector, like many others, is facing significant financial pressures. Child care providers can seek supports for businesses and individuals under the federal government's Economic Response Plan. ""We are defending the interests of consumers and protecting parents' hard-earned money by ordering child care centres to stop charging fees for services not rendered,"" said Minister Lecce. ""From protecting health and safety, to jobs and incomes, we will do whatever it takes to get our province and our incredibly resilient people through this.""  The Ontario government will continue to work with the child care sector and federal, municipal and First Nations partners on a plan to ensure the sustainability of the sector during the outbreak.

Quick Facts

Child care centres have been ordered to close through a provincial Emergency Order. 
Some child care centres that are providing child care for health care and other frontline workers, and home-based child care providers (licensed and unlicensed), are permitted to continue to operate
Over 1 million applications have been received through Ontario’s Support for Families. The simple online application gives parents a one-time payment of $200 for each child aged 0 to 12, or $250 for children 21 years old or younger with special needs.

Hospital inpatients;Residents of long-term care and retirement homes;Health care workers, caregivers, care providers, paramedics, and first responders, including police and firefighters;Remote, isolated, rural and Indigenous communities;Other congregate living centres, including homeless shelters, prisons and group homes;Specific vulnerable populations, including patients undergoing chemotherapy or hemodialysis and requiring transplants, as well as pregnant persons, newborns and cross-border workers; andOther essential workers, as defined by provincial orders.""We're laser-focused on ramping up our testing capacity so we can protect the most vulnerable in our communities and those who protect them, like our frontline health care workers and first responders,"" said Premier Ford. ""By expanding our testing capacity, we will be able to find cases faster, intervene earlier, reduce the spread, and save lives."" By implementing this strategy, Ontario expects to double the number of tests processed each day to 8,000 by April 15, 2020 and 14,000 by April 29, 2020, at which point overall lab capacity will have been further expanded. ""By significantly increasing the number of tests each day, we will identify cases early, contain them and prevent putting more people at risk,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Doing so is especially important for priority groups like hospital inpatients, long-term care home residents and our brave frontline health care workers and first responders, all of whom are more vulnerable to being exposed to this virus. Nothing is more important than protecting their health and wellbeing."" This testing strategy follows extensive efforts to expand Ontario's lab testing capacity, which helped to quickly eliminate a backlog of approximately 10,000 people within less than two weeks. To date, the province has conducted over 94,000 tests. The province has re-established same-day testing results, which are now conveniently accessible to patients through a new user-friendly online portal. This portal will help ease pressure on public health units and frontline workers, allowing them to focus their efforts on combating COVID-19. The province is also helping to significantly expand the capacity of public health units to conduct contact tracing and case management, both of which are critical to stopping the spread of the virus, by enabling the use of volunteers, including retired nurses and medical students. People who have tested negative for COVID-19 must still follow all precautions, including staying at home except to pick up essential supplies like groceries and prescriptions, and keeping at least two-meters apart from others. While an individual may receive a negative test at a given moment in time, the individual is still able to contract and spread the virus.

Quick Facts

Testing guidelines have been provided to health-system partners, including public health units, assessment centres, primary care settings and long-term care homes. Guidelines are forthcoming for specific vulnerable populations and essential workers. The province will also provide guidelines to begin targeted surveillance by sampling populations within northern towns. 
Ontario will continue to increase its testing capacity by leveraging hospital, community and research labs.
The province is also updating the list of symptoms related to COVID-19, including a hoarse voice, difficulty swallowing, loss of sense of smell or taste, diarrhea or nausea/vomiting. For seniors, there are additional symptoms including chills, delirium with no other obvious reason, falls, acute functional decline, increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure. These updated symptoms are in addition to difficulty breathing, fever, cough, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, sore throat and runny nose.
All Ontarians should stay home unless for essential reasons only, such as such as accessing health care services, shopping for groceries, picking up medication, walking pets when required, or supporting vulnerable community members with meeting essential needs. If you must leave your home, stay at least two meters apart from others.

Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to mark Good Friday:
""Christians across Ontario and around the world today will observe the sacred occasion of Good Friday and look forward with hope to the joy of Easter Sunday. Many of them will spend the day in prayer, fasting, and charitable giving to commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. While many will be unable to mark this day as they have traditionally done in the past, we strongly urge everyone to stay home and stay connected with loved ones by phone, email or virtual get-togethers. Many places of worship are working hard to connect the community of faith through the livestreaming or televising of services this weekend. I thank all of those who are doing their part to slow the spread of COVID-19 and practicing physical distancing. My thoughts today are especially with our frontline health care workers, first responders, correctional officers, and essential workers. Thank you for everything you do, and in many cases, special thanks to those who are working through the weekend to keep everyone safe and healthy. My heart also goes out to those who are struggling during this difficult period. Our government is working hard to fight this virus while supporting individuals, families and businesses. We will get through this. I wish everyone observing this solemn occasion a peaceful and prayerful Good Friday.""

Premier Ford Appoints Team to Develop Plan for Post-Pandemic Growth and Prosperity

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has launched a new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee which will focus on getting businesses up and running and people back to work after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. While the government's primary focus is on combatting the virus, supporting frontline health care workers and providing immediate relief to people and businesses, this new committee will be developing a plan to stimulate economic growth and job-creation in the weeks and months ahead.
""My heart goes out to those individuals and families who have been out of work, or whose business has closed through no fault of their own,"" said Premier Ford. ""I can assure each person affected by this crisis that we will do everything we can to support you, and get you back on the job as soon as possible. While our government battles this virus, members of our new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee will roll up their sleeves and develop a roadmap to a stronger, more prosperous economy.""   The membership of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee includes:  • Rod Phillips, Chair, Minister of Finance  • Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade  • Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board  • Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation  • Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health  • Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs  • Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines and Minister of Indigenous Affairs  • John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry  • Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure  • Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries  • Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services  • Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development  • Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction  The Committee will be consulting with a wide variety of people to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the provincial economy and develop an action plan to move forward, including business associations, chambers of commerce, municipal leaders, corporate leaders, small business owners, and entrepreneurs. ""While we focus our energy and resources on defeating COVID-19, today's job numbers highlight why we also need to plan for an economic recovery,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""At Premier Ford's request, I have convened the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee. And our first order of business is to prepare for the next phase of Ontario's Action Plan, which will be ready to launch as soon as COVID-19 is contained. This team will get our economy moving again ― with a focus on job creation, opportunities for growth, and protecting our province from future threats."" Today, Statistics Canada released its monthly job numbers, which showed a 402,800 decrease in employment in Ontario. To support the provincial effort to deal with this crisis, the government launched Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. This is a $17 billion package with funding targeted to help families and a variety of sectors across the province. In addition to $3.3 billion in more health care resources, the plan includes $3.7 billion to support people and jobs, and relief of $6 billion by temporarily deferring taxes for 100,000 Ontario businesses, $1.9 billion to allow employers to defer Workplace Safety and Insurance Board payments, and $1.8 billion to defer municipal education property tax payments. The government is also providing $52 million from the package to better support individuals and families in financial crisis through social assistance. This funding will support those who are not able to access federal assistance to cover needs such as food costs, rent, medicine and other essential services during this time. Individuals can easily apply online for assistance. To support small businesses, the Ontario government has also worked with the federal government to develop the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Loan that will enable up to $40 billion in lending, supported through Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank. This new program will help businesses meet cash flow requirements through guaranteed loans. ""Our government is pulling out all the stops to support our job creators and workers today, during this very difficult time,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""But it is incumbent upon us to look ahead and map out a plan that considers life after COVID-19, a plan that will guide us into a future filled with hope, new employment opportunities and steady economic growth."" ""While the health and safety of Ontarians is our top priority, we need to ensure that our province is positioned to support and facilitate economic growth when we lift the State of Emergency,"" said Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board. ""This starts with the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, which will ensure we have a long-term, strategic vision to responsibly reopen our economy.""

Public should exercise caution as bears come out of hibernation

April  8, 2020  5:00 P.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) remind you to exercise caution as bears begin to come out of hibernation this spring.
Black bears waking up from hibernation are faced with a scarcity of natural food sources, leading them to look for food in garbage cans and bird feeders. You can prevent bears from visiting your home and neighbourhood by:   Storing garbage in waste containers with tight-fitting lids Putting out garbage only on the morning of pickup Putting away bird feeders for the spring (you can offer birds natural alternatives, such as flowers, nesting boxes and fresh water) Cleaning food residue and grease from outdoor barbecue grills after each use Keeping pet food indoors  Bears that enter your community are not necessarily a threat, but it is important to know who to call if you encounter a bear. For non-emergencies, the province operates a toll-free Bear Wise reporting line (1-866-514-2327). The line is open 24/7 from April 1 to November 30. If a bear is posing an immediate threat by exhibiting threatening or aggressive behaviour, remain calm and call 911 or your local police department.

Quick Facts

Visit Bear Wise at Ontario.ca to learn more about how to avoid attracting bears and what to do if you encounter one.
Bears will remember their last source of food and return there when hungry, sometimes travelling over 100 kilometres.

Ontario Accelerates Essential Construction Projects During COVID-19
Extending Construction Hours Will Help Keep Ontario Workers Safe

April  8, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, Ontario is extending construction hours for essential construction projects, like critical projects in the health care sector, to 24 hours a day. Work on new hospital builds, expansions, and COVID-19 assessment centres will be able to continue any time of the night or day in order to help accelerate the construction of these important projects and enable employers to take additional steps to protect the health and safety of workers on these job sites.
Premier Doug Ford, Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, today announced extended construction hours and other measures to keep Ontario workplaces safe. ""During this escalating crisis, we are taking immediate steps to ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place, particularly to properly care for those with severe COVID-19 symptoms and other patients who require critical care,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""That's why we're extending construction hours to allow us to build essential infrastructure faster, while ensuring construction workers can practice physical distancing on work sites to stay safe and healthy."" Ontario will temporarily limit local noise bylaws from applying to these types of essential construction activities beginning April 7, 2020. This will allow for expedited construction on key facilities, such as new hospital builds, expansions, temporary COVID-19 response units or structures, and COVID-19 assessment centres. Extending hours for essential construction will also give worksite managers more flexibility to stagger shifts, limit the number of people in one place, and take reasonable precautions to keep workers safe and healthy under the recent guidelines issued by Ontario's Chief Prevention Officer for construction sites. Ontario is also making essential workplaces across the province safer during the COVID-19 pandemic by: Redeploying more than 30 employment standards officers to help businesses understand and comply with health and safety requirements;Working with health and safety associations to deploy up to 30 specialists to support employers and workers in the field;Issuing health and safety guidance notes to support specific sectors;Doubling the capacity of Ontario's Health and Safety Call Centre from 25 to 50 phonelines;Providing job-protected leave under the Employment Standards Act for workers who need to self-isolate or care for a loved one because of COVID-19;Issuing a call to recently-retired inspectors who may be able and willing to return to their positions;Providing compliance assistance and enforcing the emergency orders issued under the Emergency Measures and Civil Protection Act.""Our government is doing everything in its power to make sure workers on the job are safe during this pandemic,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""That means more inspections, more inspectors, more phone lines, and more people to take your calls. We have conducted thousands of inspections and investigations across the province in March and we will continue to conduct more this month. We will do everything in our power to keep the essential workers of our province safe."" ""We're helping to protect the health and safety of construction workers and ensure that critical health care-related construction projects continue during this outbreak,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""Temporarily limiting noise bylaws to extend the hours for construction work will help make it possible to stagger shifts and have fewer workers on site at any given time so they can practice physical distancing."" ""As part of our plan to stop the spread of COVID-19, we are continuing to expand health care capacity in communities across the province,"" said Minister Elliott. ""That includes building new assessment centres and field hospitals, both of which are critical to ensuring we are able to care for Ontarians as we contain this new virus. Extended hours will ensure that work on these facilities continues safely to the benefit of all Ontarians.""

Quick Facts

All Ontarians should stay home unless absolutely necessary for essential reasons, such as such as accessing health care services, shopping for groceries, picking up medication, walking pets when required, or supporting vulnerable community members with meeting essential needs. If you must leave your home, stay at least two (2) meters apart from others.
If you think you may have COVID-19 symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has it, first self-isolate and then use Ontario's Self-Assessment Tool to see if you need to seek further care.
Take these everyday steps to reduce exposure to the virus and protect your health: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer; sneeze and cough into your sleeve; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth; avoid contact with people who are sick; and stay home if you are sick.

Ministry of Indigenous Affairs


TORONTO- As part of Ontario's Action Plan: Response to COVID-19, the Ontario government is investing over $37 million to support outbreak planning, prevention and mitigation efforts to ensure the health and well-being of Indigenous people and communities — particularly those in remote and far-northern regions.
""Indigenous communities face unique challenges in planning for and tackling the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs. ""We are working closely with Indigenous leaders and making critical investments to ensure Indigenous people and communities have the necessary tools and supports in place to stop the spread of COVID-19."" The funding will respond to the unique needs of First Nations, Métis and Inuit people and families across the province. The total of $37.8 million includes:  $16.4 million from the Ministry of Indigenous Affairs to provide emergency funds for food, household goods, critical supplies, transportation, and support and care, responsive services and supports for urban Indigenous people, self-isolation facilities in remote and northern communities, prevention and awareness efforts, and pandemic planning;$10 million from the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services to support Indigenous communities and agencies in responding to the needs of vulnerable children, families and elders during the outbreak;$7.4 million from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing to help social service providers, charities and non-profits delivering critical housing services to Indigenous people living off-reserve; and$4 million from the Ministry of Transportation to ensure continued service to remote and northern airports, enabling essential goods and services to continue reaching isolated communities. ""We know the continuation of social services is critical to the unique needs of First Nations, Inuit, Métis and urban Indigenous communities. We're committed to responding to those needs now and as they continue to develop,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services.  In addition to this funding, the government is working with the Indigenous business community to assess how to address the impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous businesses, economies and workers.   ""We are acting quickly to support Indigenous people living off-reserve who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless during this unprecedented time,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""This funding will go straight to Indigenous service providers, who know best what the immediate needs are on the ground."" The Ministry of Transportation (MTO) owns and operates 29 airports, with 26 serving remote First Nations communities. These airports provide a vital link to Indigenous communities, enabling shipments of essential supplies, such as food, fuel and water, and connecting essential services, including health care, education and social services. The ministry will work cooperatively with Indigenous communities wishing to enact their own measures related to the COVID-19 outbreak, including consideration of requests for the full or partial closures of MTO airports. ""We recognize these airports are lifelines to the communities they serve, many of which are isolated,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Our investment will ensure that critical services and goods continue to be available to First Nations and northern communities.""

Province Launches Online Portal to Match Available Health Care Workers with Employers

April  7, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is taking further action to stop the spread of COVID-19 by actively recruiting health care workers to increase the frontline capacity of hospitals, clinics, and assessment centres. Today, the province is launching a new online tool that will help match skilled frontline workers with employers.
The new Health Workforce Matching Portal will enable health care providers with a range of experience to join the province's response to COVID-19. Those providers include retired or non-active health care professionals, internationally educated health care professionals, students, and volunteers with health care experience. The portal will efficiently match the availability and skillsets of frontline health care workers to the employers in need of assistance to perform a variety of public health functions, such as case and contact management. ""Our health care heroes on the frontlines of this battle are doing extraordinary work, but they need reinforcements to step up and lend a hand to help defeat this virus,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""Whether you're retired or in training, we can't afford to have people with professional health care skills who want to help sitting on the sidelines during this crisis. This is a call to action and I encourage every available person with health care experience to get involved."" Employers and interested health care professionals can visit the portal here and create a profile. Once registered, professionals can add their availability and employers can enter their request for support. Registrants will receive an email notification if matched. ""Since the beginning of this outbreak, we have heard from thousands of volunteers who want to help in any way they can,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are very grateful for those stepping up during these unprecedented times. That's why we are using everything possible to support these frontline healthcare workers as they fight the spread of this virus."" On April 1, Ontario issued a new emergency order under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, to enhance the public health units' human resources capacity and support their ongoing fight against COVID-19.

Ontario Takes Additional Measures to Protect First Responders During the COVID-19 Outbreak


April  6, 2020  2:07 P.M.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, issued the following statement regarding new emergency measures to protect Ontario's first responders and stop the spread of COVID-19:
""First responders put their lives on the line every day to protect Ontarians and they are at great risk of being directly exposed to COVID-19 as they fulfill their frontline duties. We must do everything in our power to ensure the health and well-being of those working on the frontlines and provide them with the tools they need to do their jobs and keep Ontarians safe. With their safety and health in mind, our government has made an emergency order that will allow police, firefighters and paramedics to obtain COVID-19 positive status information about individuals with whom they are coming into contact. During this pandemic, it is crucial that our first responders have access to this critical information when they are preparing to respond to an emergency in order to protect themselves and the public and help stop the spread of this virus. The information disclosed will be limited to an individual's name, address, date of birth, and whether the individual has had a positive COVID-19 test result. Strict protocols will be enforced to limit access to this information and will only be used to allow first responders to take appropriate safety precautions to protect themselves and the communities they serve. Once the declaration of emergency is lifted, this data will be made inaccessible to first responders. We will continue to take decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of all Ontarians.""

Ontario Providing Relief for Remote Northern Property Taxpayers During COVID-19
Province Deferring Provincial Land Tax Payments for 90 Days

April  6, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ontario government is deferring $15 million in property taxes for people and businesses in parts of Northern Ontario located outside of municipal boundaries. This tax deferral builds on the $10 billion in cash flow supports made available to people and businesses as part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. 
""Our government is taking action to protect every person and every business across Ontario during this unprecedented time, including remote parts of Northern Ontario,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""All communities are feeling the impacts of this global outbreak. That's why we're providing a measure of relief for the owners of over 63,000 residential and business properties outside municipal boundaries."" Through these measures, Ontario is giving taxpayers in unincorporated areas more time to pay each of the four 2020 Provincial Land Tax installments. Taxpayers will have 90 extra days to pay without incurring interest or penalties.  For example, taxpayers who would be required to pay the April 7 property tax installment will have until July 6 to pay without interest or penalties. This action is complementary to new support for municipalities that was announced in Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. In this plan, the Province announced it is deferring the upcoming quarterly (June 30) remittance of education property tax to school boards by 90 days. This will provide municipalities with the flexibility to, in turn, provide property tax deferrals of over $1.8 billion to local residents and businesses. ""Additional cash flow during these tough times can help keep food on the table for people in every corner of the province,"" said Minister Phillips. ""That's why we've made $10 billion in cash flow support available through tax and other deferrals as part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. The Province is doing its part and we're grateful to our partners in the other levels of government for doing theirs.""

Quick Facts

The Provincial Land Tax is the property tax paid in unincorporated areas of northern Ontario outside municipal boundaries. The Province directly collects this tax to help fund community services, such as policing, land ambulance, public health and social services in unincorporated areas. 
This deferral of unincorporated area property tax payments applies to all of the levies that are collected through the consolidated Provincial Land Tax bill. This includes Provincial Land Tax, education property tax, and any Local Road Board and Local Service Board levies that are paid through the Provincial Land Tax bill.
To ensure this deferral does not have a financial impact on Local Roads and Services Boards, which provide additional services in these remote communities, the Province will continue to make payments to these partners, as scheduled. In addition, to ensure this does not have a financial impact on school boards, the Province will adjust payments to school boards to offset the deferral.
Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID 19 includes $7 billion in direct supports for health care, people and jobs and makes available approximately $10 billion in support for people and businesses through tax and other deferrals to improve their cash flows. This $17 billion plan outlines the government’s first steps in response to COVID-19.

Province Providing One-time Financial Assistance During School and Child Care Closures 

April  6, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is offering direct financial support to parents while Ontario schools and child care centres remain closed as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The new Support for Families initiative offers a one-time payment of $200 per child 0 to 12 years of age, and $250 for those 0 to 21 years of age with special needs. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""During this extraordinary time, we're doing everything we can to support parents to keep everyone safe and ensure our children continue to learn and stay mentally active,"" said Premier Ford. ""This one-time funding will allow parents to access additional tools for our kids to use while at home and studying remotely. I want to remind everyone to stay at home and only go out if absolutely necessary. It's the only way we are going to defeat this terrible virus."" ""Our aim during these extraordinarily challenging times is to continue supporting those impacted hardest by the COVID-19 outbreak — Ontario families,"" said Minister Lecce. ""School and child care closures have disrupted family life a great deal and our government will do whatever it takes to support them and keep them safe. This funding will flow to parents directly, to offer them immediate relief during this difficult time."" Families can complete a simple online application at Ontario's Support for Families web page to access this financial support. Parents already receiving Support for Parents payments through direct deposit will be automatically eligible for this financial support and do not need to submit a new application. ""As we reach a critical juncture in our fight against COVID-19, it's important schools and child care centres remain closed,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Keeping Ontarians safe is our number one priority and it's also our duty to help parents who are supporting their children and families during this unprecedented time."" Through this initiative the government is providing over $300 million in relief to parents across Ontario as part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. ""With schools and child care closed, life has become more difficult for families and they need some extra help,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, includes $7 billion in direct support for people and jobs, and $10 billion in cash flow support for people and businesses. This $17 billion plan includes direct relief for parents when they need it the most.""

Quick Facts

Ontario public schools will remain closed to teachers until Friday, May 1, 2020, and to students until Monday, May 4, 2020, to keep Ontario’s students safe from COVID-19. Private schools, licensed child care centres and EarlyON programs will also remain closed until April 13, according to the Declaration of Emergency, which only allows closures to be extended for one 14-day period at a time.
On March 22, Ontario announced its effort to support health care and frontline workers with emergency child care services across the province. Frontline workers who make use of these services are also eligible for this one-time payment.
The Government reiterated its focus on positive mental health supports for students dealing with the challenges of COVID-19. Premier Ford announced an investment of up to $12 million to deliver online and virtual mental health supports across our province, supporting students, families and frontline workers. 
Ontario launched the second phase of Learn at Home and Apprendre à la maison, a new online portal that provides resources for families so students can continue their education while schools are closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation.

Province providing relief funding for residential service providers that support vulnerable populations

April  4, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


TORONTO — As part of the Government of Ontario’s efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, the province is investing up to $40 million to support organizations that provide residential services for children and youth, people with developmental disabilities and emergency shelters for women and families fleeing domestic violence.
The COVID-19 Residential Relief Fund will cover costs such as additional staffing, residential respite for caregivers; personal protective equipment and supplies; initiatives to support physical distancing and transportation to minimize client exposure.  “Our government is doing everything it can to help Ontario’s most vulnerable get through this difficult and challenging time,”  said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services “I want to personally thank all the staff and managers who are working on the frontlines of the developmental services sector for keeping our most vulnerable citizens safe during this unprecedented time. You exemplify the true Ontario spirit each and every day.”  Ontario is also taking action to help ensure that staffing and resources are available to help care for and protect people with developmental disabilities and the frontline workers who support them. These temporary measures provide further flexibility for developmental service agencies to redirect their staffing and financial resources to essential tasks that keep individuals with developmental disabilities safe and out of hospital. The Relief Fund will also help address increased residential costs that emergency shelters for women fleeing domestic violence and survivors of human trafficking are facing at this time. “This is a trying time for everyone, as we continue to stay at home to stop the spread of COVID-19, but we know that home isn’t safe for everyone. That’s why it’s critical during this time that residential organizations for people fleeing violence have the security they need to continue supporting vulnerable women,” said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women’s Issues.

New online portal connects employers with workers looking to make a difference

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


TORONTO - In order to ensure grocery store shelves remain full and families have food on the table during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government of Ontario is launching a new web portal, connecting workers with employers looking to fill positions in the agri-food sector. This new online tool will make it easier to match people to essential jobs and training resources throughout the provincial food supply chain.
""Right now, there are important jobs that need to be filled across the food supply chain and we are looking for individuals who embody the Ontario spirit to step up and provide an essential service,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""From farm to fork, it's these dedicated heroes in the agri-food sector who are working through this difficult period each and every day to keep food on our kitchen tables."" Ontario's agriculture and food industry relies on hundreds of thousands of people to work in diverse jobs from farming and food processing to transport and food retail, and the need for workers in many other parts of the food system remains strong. Ontario.ca/AgFoodJobs provides access to information on job opportunities and training resources in all parts of Ontario's food supply chain - from grocery retailers to bakeries and cheese processing plants to opportunities on farms. ""Working in the agri-food sector is a great way to contribute to your community and join the thousands of hard-working men and women helping to feed the province during this unprecedented time,"" said Minister Hardeman. ""Our food supply chain is one of the strongest in the world and our government wants to thank all of the people who work everyday to ensure individuals and families can access healthy and nutritious Ontario-produced foods.""

Quick Facts

Ontario’s agri-food sector is comprised of primary agriculture, food, beverage and wholesale, and retail and food services.
In 2018, Ontario's agri-food industry employed more than 837,000 people, representing 11.6 per cent of the province’s labour force and contributed $47.7 billion in GDP to the provincial economy (6.6 per cent of total Ontario GDP).

""As the province takes decisive action to safeguard the health and safety of Ontarians, we are taking immediate action to protect seniors living in retirement homes. A temporary order has been made under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act that will help retirement homes address emergency staffing needs as they respond to COVID-19. With this temporary action, retirement homes will have more flexibility to recruit and reassign staff to address the impacts of this new virus and will be able to focus more resources toward implementing the protocols and procedures put in place to keep residents safe. Retirement homes are also required to report any outbreak of COVID-19 to the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority, as well as the local medical officer of health. These important measures are aligned with similar orders issued for hospitals and long-term care homes and will allow retirement homes to more quickly deploy personnel as needed. To further safeguard the health of seniors living in retirement homes our government has also amended the Retirement Homes Act, 2010 requiring that all retirement homes follow the Chief Medical Officer of Health's guidance and recommendations regarding infection control and prevention. We are also investing $20 million in additional funding to support increased infection control and active screening measures. Our government will continue to take decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19 to protect the health and safety of Ontarians, especially Ontario's most vulnerable people.""

Ontario Provides Full Transparency by Releasing COVID-19 Modelling
Projected number of cases and deaths can be significantly reduced if people stay home

April  3, 2020  3:45 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO - Today, the Ontario government released extensive COVID-19 modelling, revealing several scenarios that project the potential number of cases and deaths. In doing so, the province is providing the public with full transparency about the consequences should everyone but essential workers fail to stay home and practice physical distancing.
""The models show that the potential to spread COVID-19 is massive and deadly if we don't act swiftly to stay home and practise physical distancing,"" said Premier Ford. ""We owe it to our frontline and essential workers, to our family, friends and neighbours to restrict our travel, and act responsibly. This is the only way we are going to minimize the risk to people, stop the spread and reduce the number of fatalities."" Key highlights from the modelling include: While COVID-19 impacts Ontarians of all ages, those over the age of 60 face higher risk of severe disease leading to higher mortality rates. The data demonstrates the need to focus public health measures on protecting seniors.Had Ontario taken no action, the impact of COVID-19 would have risen to an estimated 300,000 cases and an estimated death toll of 6,000 people.Due to timely public health measures, Ontario has avoided much more dire impacts, preventing an estimated 220,000 cases and 4,400 deaths to date.Over the course of the pandemic, between 3,000 and 15,000 deaths related to COVID-19 are predicted with current public health measures in place, compared to a total projected 100,000 deaths if no action were taken.By taking further measures, Ontario can further reduce the number of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 down to projections as low as 12,500 additional cases and 200 additional deaths by the end of April.On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, Ontario will continue to take decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19. Most recently, the province banned organized public events and social gatherings of more than five people and closed all outdoor recreational amenities, such as sports fields and playgrounds. At the same time, the province's COVID-19 Command Table has been implementing extensive measures to build health-system capacity to prepare for increased hospitalizations. ""Ontario is entering a critical juncture in our fight against COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""The numbers released today are sobering. While they reveal a disastrous path, they also serve as a call to arms for greater action. We have for months now been preparing for this very moment, but to avoid the worst-case scenario we are relying on every Ontarian to stay home to stop the spread of this virus. Lives depend on the public heeding this advice."" ""We feel is it important to be transparent with the public about the challenges we are facing, and the important work we all need to do to flatten the curve,"" said Dr. Peter Donnelly, President and CEO of Public Health Ontario. ""How this outbreak unfolds is in the hands of the public, in all of your hands. We can change the outcomes by how we all stay at home and physically distance ourselves.""

TORONTO — Following the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government is reducing the list of businesses classified as essential and ordering more workplaces to close. This measure is necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of the people of Ontario, while ensuring that necessary goods and services remain available.
The government is ordering all businesses not covered by the updated Emergency Order to close effective as of Saturday, April 4, 2020 at 11:59 p.m. This closure will be in effect for 14 days, with the possibility of an extension as the situation evolves.

If you are not an essential business, you need to close your doors, work from home if possible and play a role to help contain this outbreak. This is a matter of life and death."" As a temporary measure the Ontario government has revised the list of essential businesses. The updated list will direct additional businesses to close and restricts specified businesses to providing services by alternate methods such as curb side pick up and delivery, except in exceptional circumstances. This includes stores that sell hardware products, vehicle parts and supplies, pet and animal supplies, office supplies and computer products and repairs and safety supplies. ""We have now reached a critical time in our fight against COVID-19."" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health ""Every step taken by the province and every effort made by each of us to avoid close contact with others are the key to our success as a province to stop the spread of this virus."" Only critical construction projects will continue, including industrial projects such as refineries and petrochemical plants and infrastructure projects such as new hospitals, roads and bridges. New starts in residential projects will stop, while residential construction that is near completion will continue. Business-owners with questions concerning their essential business status are encouraged to call the Stop the Spread hotline at 1-888-444-3659. The hotline is available from 8:30 a.m.― 9:00 p.m. Monday to Friday and 8:30 a.m.— 5:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.  ""We recognize the toll this outbreak is taking on business owners and workers,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Ontario businesses are top of mind during this unprecedented time. We know that the only way to ensure the health of our businesses and our economy is to ensure the health of all Ontarians."" The government is implementing additional measures to protect frontline workers in essential businesses by adding more than 60 special consultants and officers and doubling the number of phone agents at its Health and Safety Call Centre to 50 to make it easier for workers to report safety concerns. Workers worried their workplaces are unsafe can phone 1-877-202-0008 to speak with an agent. ""If you're a worker on the frontlines of this outbreak, you should know we're doing everything in our power to keep you safe at work,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""We're beefing up our inspectors and making it easier for you to report your concerns. We're working around the clock.""

Quick Facts

Ontario Increasing Public Health Units' Capacity to Stop COVID-19


April  3, 2020  7:30 A.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — To support public health units' extensive efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, Ontario is taking further action to redirect existing resources to focus squarely on the fight against this new virus while allowing for public health units to considerably increase their capacity.
Ontario has launched a new user-friendly online portal for the public to easily access their COVID-19 lab test results. By offering faster and secure access to test results on their computer or mobile device, this portal will help ease pressures on public health units and frontline workers to provide this information so that they can better focus on containing COVID-19. ""With this new portal, patients will be able to access their test results faster from the safety of their home,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""It will help reduce the burden on our public health units and frontline health workers, allowing them to focus their efforts where they are needed most during this challenging time."" Ontario is also issuing a new emergency order under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, effective immediately, to provide public health units the authority and flexibility they need to make staffing decisions that support their ongoing fight against the outbreak of COVID-19, despite any collective agreements. As a result, public health units will be able to significantly expand their capacity to implement critical public health functions, such as case and contact management, through the use of volunteers, including the thousands of retired nurses and medical students who have signed up through the province's website. This latest order will support the recommendation made by Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, for all public health units to implement more aggressive contact tracing and management in response to the increase of community transmission. The province's medical officers of health are also encouraged to use their authority under Section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act to ensure isolation of cases and contacts of COVID-19. ""We are at a critical juncture in our fight against COVID-19,"" said Elliott. ""Our success as a province depends on our ability to quickly and effectively stop the spread of this new virus. These actions offer considerable support to our local health units and give them the authority they need to act and contain COVID-19 in our communities.""

Quick Facts

Patients will be asked to verify their identity with the information on their photo health card. The portal will provide patients with their test results and offer guidance on next steps.
On March 30, 2020, Dr. Williams issued a statement to strongly encourage Ontarians to stay home, limit the number of essential trips and adhere to physical distancing.

Ontario Reducing Risk of Fire in the Province
Supporting emergency responders by restricting all outdoor fires in Ontario’s fire region during COVID-19 outbreak

April  2, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


TORONTO — The Ontario government is taking action to protect people and communities from the risk of preventable human-caused fires and to ensure that the province's emergency response system remains strong during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Starting April 3, 2020, Ontario's entire legislated fire region will be designated a Restricted Fire Zone. Residents who live in an area with a restricted fire zone cannot have an outdoor fire—this includes burning of grass, debris and campfires, even when using an outdoor fire grate, fire place or fire pit. ""During this very challenging time when we are fighting the spread of the virus, our number one priority is the health and safety of the people of Ontario,"" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""We are putting these important preventative measures in place now to ensure that our emergency responders are able to focus their efforts where they are needed most."" This restriction will remain in place until Ontario's ability to respond to emergencies is no longer impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Local municipalities are working to update their websites with information for residents. Meanwhile, Ontarians can learn about the rules under a Restricted Fire Zone at ontario.ca/page/outdoor-fire-restrictions.

Additional Resources will Improve Access to Online and Virtual Supports 

April  2, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Ontario government is making it easier for everyone, especially those on the front lines, to reach out for mental health support during the COVID-19 outbreak. To improve access, the province is providing emergency funding of up to $12 million to immediately expand online and virtual mental health supports and $2.6 million to hire new psychologists and other mental health workers to support Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) personnel.
""Dealing with an evolving crisis like COVID-19 puts a lot of stress on everyone, including people who are self-isolating, families with kids out of school, and the frontline health care workers and first responders who are keeping us safe each and every day,"" said Premier Ford. ""This very difficult situation will impact different people in different ways, but I can assure everyone we will be there to support you and help you cope in every way we can. Clearly, protecting our health and well-being is everything, and that includes our mental health."" These services will help people experiencing anxiety, stress and other mental health challenges, including people who are unable to access their regular in-person counselling supports. These resources will address the needs of youth and adults and will include more dedicated supports for those working on the frontlines who are dealing with the difficult realities of COVID-19 every single day. ""It's never been more important for Ontarians to stay home to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""As they do, we need to provide them with the supports they need to stay mentally healthy during these challenging times as more Ontarians experience heightened anxiety and depression."" With this investment, mental health agencies will receive emergency funding to hire and train more staff and purchase necessary equipment, appropriate technology and additional licenses. The emergency funding will immediately expand services, based on evidence-informed cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), on a range of platforms including:   BounceBack: A guided self-help program for adults and youth aged 15 and over using workbooks with online videos and phone coaching support.Kids Help Phone: 24/7 virtual support service offering professional counselling, information and referrals as well as volunteer-led, text-based support to young people in both English and French at 1-800-668-6868.Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT): Online CBT , supported by therapists; available in English and French.iCBT for frontline health care workers: Online CBT targeted at frontline health care workers experiencing anxiety, burnout or PTSD. Those requiring intensive levels of care could be referred to virtual face-to-face care. Training for Brief CBT-based interventions: Training will be provided to frontline workers in organizations such as Telehealth and emergency departments in order to better support individuals experiencing acute anxiety due to the pandemic.The hiring of additional mental health workers for the OPP is in response to four of the 66 recommendations made by the OPP Independent Review Panel (IRP) in its final report. Established in April 2019 to examine the OPP's workplace culture, the IRP was also tasked to look into how the OPP addresses issues of mental health, occupational stress injuries and suicide among its members and provide a series of recommendations. The funding will help the OPP hire mental health workers who will: Provide clinical services to members of all ranks and make referrals to external services if needed;Develop and deliver mental health support programming specific to unique policing needs (e.g. geographical, specialized services, cultural);Facilitate educational programs to both uniform and civilian members to reduce stigma and promote resiliency and access to help when facing mental health challenges; andProvide guidance in peer support programs.""The current COVID-19 outbreak reinforces how much we rely on front lines workers and why it is so important to look after their mental health and wellbeing,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""With this new assistance, OPP personnel will get access to the mental health support they need to continue protecting our communities."" ""Many Ontarians, including our dedicated first responders, are experiencing increased anxiety because of COVID-19 and are worried about their health, the health of their family and friends, and the future of their livelihoods,"" said Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. ""We continue to work with our partners across the mental health and addictions sector to fund more innovative services such as internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy, ensuring Ontarians receive the high-quality care they expect and deserve."" Where to Find Help: For Ontarians currently receiving mental health and addictions services and supports, please contact your current service provider to learn about potential virtual care options.For Ontarians interested in public addictions services and mental health services for those over 18, they can contact ConnexOntario, Ontario's mental health, addictions and problem gambling help line at 1-866-531-2600.Children and youth under 18 can locate mental health services through the Ontario.ca and Kids Help Phone websites, or contact Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868) for 24/7 support, if they need someone to talk to.Good2Talk is a free, confidential mental health support service providing professional counselling and information and referrals for mental health, addictions and well-being to postsecondary students in Ontario, 24/7/365.

Attorney General announces $4 million to support victims and protect front-line justice staff

April  2, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of the Attorney General


TORONTO - Attorney General Doug Downey today announced emergency action to support victims of crime and protect front-line staff who continue to uphold the administration of justice in response to COVID-19.
The government of Ontario is providing an emergency payment of more than $2.7 million to support services for victims of domestic violence and other violent crimes during the COVID-19 crisis. ""Staying home is unfortunately not always the safest option in certain households and sadly a recent increase in domestic violence has been reported to front-line victim service organizations,"" said Attorney General Downey. ""This emergency payment will ensure victims of crime, particularly those who are experiencing domestic violence, get the help they need  to stay safe and healthy during this crisis."" This additional one-time emergency payment will help more than 50 community agencies across Ontario, including victim crisis assistance organizations (VCAOs), Indigenous organizations and those based in rural areas, stay operational and accessible to victims during the public health crisis. Funds will help front-line staff respond to challenges caused by the COVID-19 crisis and enhance access to immediate supports for victims, including extended hotels stays, and transportation and meal vouchers available through the Victim Quick Response Program Plus (VQRP+). ""During the COVID-19 health emergency, victim service providers are seeing a spike in domestic violence cases just as victims are left with fewer and fewer places to turn for help,"" said Ontario Network of Victim Service Provider President, Sheri MacDonald. ""The Attorney General and his staff understand what we're facing on the front lines and his cooperation and decisive action make a true difference for our clients."" Ontario is also working closely with justice partners to ensure critical services continue while keeping essential front-line workers and all Ontarians safe.  To support these efforts, the government is investing $1.3 million in technology to help courts and tribunals continue the transition to remote operations. Investments include additional laptops, conference lines and doubling the complement of digital recording devices for court use. This funding was announced on March 25th in Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. Ontario's courts and tribunals continue to shift to audio and video conferencing to hear priority matters. To date, all courtrooms in the Ontario Court of Justice are operating remotely. Matters involving individuals held in custody are now being held remotely, removing the need for transportation and transfers between correctional facilities and courthouses. Ontario is also working with justice partners to support the transition to remote operations, including expanding e-filing tools. ""I want to thank the Superior and Ontario Courts of Justice, the Court of Appeal, Tribunals Ontario, front-line workers, including the province's dedicated crown attorneys and committed court staff, and other partners for working with our government to limit attendance at courthouses and enforce strict physical distancing measures to protect essential workers in the justice system and keep all Ontarians safe,"" said Attorney General Downey. Additional Quotes ""Victim Services Toronto commends the Attorney General for taking swift action during this crisis to support vulnerable victims and shore up essential services. Victim Services Toronto is extremely pleased the Ontario Government is taking all possible steps to support Ontarians during this crisis."" — Bonnie Levine, Executive Director, Victim Services Toronto ""I am excited about this good news for Six Nations and other First Nations who support victim services in their communities. We welcome these additional resources that will benefit Indigenous people as we work together to face this outbreak."" — Barb General, Justice Director, Six Nations Indigenous Victim Services ""Increasing the budget and staffing will enhance the quality of services Victim Services of Simcoe County can provide to clients. This investment will help our employees do more valuable work for victims."" — Robert Burke, Inspector, Barrie Police Service and Chair, Victim Services of Simcoe County ""I would like to commend the Attorney General, Doug Downey and the Province of Ontario, for being responsive to the needs of victims of crime during this unprecedented time of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19."" — Gillian Freeman, Executive Director, Victims Services York

 Ontario Supports Trucking Sector for Keeping Goods Moving


April  2, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Transportation


TORONTO - Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation issued the following statement on supporting truck drivers during the COVID-19 outbreak:
""In these extraordinary times, we have extraordinary heroes. Our truck drivers are these heroes. They are working long hours, day and night delivering food and equipment and other essential supplies for Ontario families.   Our truck drivers deserve our respect, our support, our thanks and our best efforts to help them as they continue to make sure we can put food on our tables and pick up other necessary items.  We have heard from those working within the trucking industry of the treatment that truck drivers have faced while travelling on our roads. In response, we are calling on all business owners to support truck drivers when they are stopping to rest, get gas or use washrooms.  This will better keep our truck drivers safe and healthy and on the road.  We expect businesses who rely on truck drivers to provide necessary facilities for these heroes. We need everyone to do their part to make sure drivers can keep doing their jobs safely.  As a government we are working closely with truck drivers and associations to respond to the issues they face on the road. We are providing more safe places for truck drivers to stop and rest across the province and are keeping all 23 ONroute travel plazas open for take-out, grab and go and drive-through services, including washrooms with enhanced cleaning. We are also providing portable washrooms at 32 truck inspection stations so trucks have a place to stop and rest safely. These actions build on measures announced last month that allow the 24-hour delivery of goods without the restrictions of municipal noise by-laws, and the extension of the validation of driver's licences, Commercial Vehicle Operator's Registration certificates and other products that expired on or after March 1, 2020.  Ontario is committed to supporting the trucking industry and we would like to thank commercial carriers and truck drivers for everything that they've done to keep goods moving during the COVID-19 outbreak.""

The government has recently placed an order with O-Two Medical Technologies who, with the support of Ontario's world-class manufacturing sector, will produce 10,000 ventilator units. ""Our government is taking extraordinary measures to support businesses and organizations that are responding to COVID-19,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade.

Public Required to Identify Themselves if Charged with Breaching an Emergency Order During the COVID-19 Outbreak

Ministry of the Solicitor General


TORONTO — People who are being charged with an offence under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) will be required to identify themselves if asked by a provincial offences officer, which includes police officers, First Nations constables, special constables and municipal by-law enforcement officers. This temporary power was approved by the Ontario government today through an emergency order to better protect people during this COVID-19 outbreak. 
""It is essential that measures are in place to allow provincial offences officers to lawfully require an individual to disclose their correct name, date of birth and address in order to protect our communities,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""By providing provincial offences officers with this temporary power to obtain identifying information under the EMCPA, they will be able to enforce emergency orders during these extraordinary times."" Emergency orders currently in place to address the COVID-19 outbreak include the closure of non-essential businesses, prohibiting organized public events and social gatherings of more than five people and stopping price gouging on necessary goods such as disinfectant products. Failing to comply with any of these emergency orders is an offence under the EMCPA and so is the failure to identify oneself accurately.  Failing to correctly identify oneself carries a fine of $750 for failure to comply with an order made under the EMCPA or $1,000 for obstructing any person in exercising a power if a provincial offences officer issues a ticket. In addition, failure to comply with an emergency order could carry punishments of up to one-year imprisonment or a fine of up to $100,000 for an individual, $500,000 for a director of a corporation, or $10,000,000 for a corporation itself if a provincial offences officer charges the individual by issuing a summons. These penalties apply in addition to the penalties for breaching other emergency orders. ""It is the responsibility of all Ontarians to do their part and respect the emergency orders in place. We are supporting provincial offences officer in their critical work to enforce that responsibility and ensure the safety and well-being of Ontarians,"" added Solicitor General Jones.

Ontario Enabling Students to Complete the Academic Year, Offering Loan Payment Deferrals and Financial Support for Institutions 

March 31, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Colleges and Universities


TORONTO — The government of Ontario is easing the financial burden on students and making sure they can complete their studies during the COVID-19 outbreak by temporarily deferring payments for Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) loans and making online learning supports, including year-end exams, available to postsecondary institutions.
""During this unprecedented period, it is important to help students and current borrowers, so students can continue with their studies and borrowers do not have to worry about making loan payments,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our government is doing everything it can to ensure our college and university students can take their exams and complete their school year while studying remotely.""    To support borrowers during this difficult period, loan repayments will be subject to a six-month interest-free moratorium until September 30, 2020. This means that during this time, borrowers will not be required to make any loan payments and interest will not accrue on their OSAP loans. Borrowers can still make one-time payments via their online account or online banking if they want to repay their loans faster. Payments during this period will go entirely towards their loan principal.    ""Students and their families make great sacrifices to attend postsecondary education and it is incumbent on us to do everything we can to ensure this academic year is not put in jeopardy,"" said Minister Romano. ""I want to thank our postsecondary institutions for their leadership in adopting alternative ways for students to study and take exams, while ensuring they practice physical distancing and stay safe."" To ensure students can successfully complete the academic year, Ontario has finalized an agreement with eCampusOntario to make digital learning supports available to postsecondary institutions. These interim digital learning supports, available in both French and English, will provide publicly-assisted colleges and universities with the technology they need to conduct year-end assessments, while preserving student privacy and the integrity of academic assessment. Ontario will work with other partners who may be interested in offering digital learning, such as Indigenous Institutes and private career colleges. Supports will be accessible on an as-needed basis and limited to those courses and programs where formal exams are required. The province is also distributing $25 million in additional funding to publicly-assisted colleges, universities and Indigenous Institutes to help address each institution's most pressing needs in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak such as deep cleaning, purchasing medical supplies or offering mental health supports.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — In an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep people home, the Government of Ontario has extended the Declaration of Emergency and associated emergency measures, including the closure of non-essential workplaces and restrictions on social gatherings. In addition, Ontario is issuing a new emergency order under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to close all outdoor recreational amenities, such as sports fields and playgrounds, effective immediately. These actions are based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health.
""I made a commitment to be open and upfront about what we need to do as a province to beat this virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""Based on the best medical advice available, we are taking further steps today to protect the health and safety of all Ontarians by closing outdoor recreational amenities, like sports fields and playgrounds, and extending our emergency orders to save lives. We all need to work together and do our part to stop COVID-19 by staying home, practising physical distancing, and avoiding social gatherings."" This new order would close all communal or shared, public or private, outdoor recreational amenities everywhere in Ontario, including but not limited to playgrounds, sports fields, basketball and tennis courts, off-leash dog parks, benches, skateboard and BMX parks, picnic areas, outdoor community gardens, park shelters, outdoor exercise equipment, condo parks and gardens, and other outdoor recreational amenities. Green spaces in parks, trails, ravines and conservation areas that aren't otherwise closed would remain open for walkthrough access, but individuals must maintain the safe physical distance of at least two metres apart from others.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Ontario is taking further action to protect frontline nurses and to recognize their clinical training and experience to help to keep Ontarians and hospitals safe and healthy during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The province, in collaboration with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, and in consultation with the Ontario Nurses' Association (ONA), Ontario Health and the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA), is issuing a directive on health and safety standards for frontline nurses in hospitals in order to prevent exposure to and transmission of COVID-19. These standards have been developed with the guidance of clinically trained frontline nurses, hospital leaders and public health experts. ""It is critical that we are protecting our frontline nurses who are fighting to protect us from COVID-19 every day,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are collaborating with our partners in the health system to implement this new directive to ensure that nurses have the protection they need to safely provide the best care for their patients."" This directive outlines:  Precautions for interactions with suspected, presumed or confirmed COVID-19 patients, including relying on the clinical education and training that nurses receive to use their professional and clinical judgement;Point-of-care risk assessments for every patient interaction to assess appropriate health and safety measures; andTraining on safe use of all personal protective equipment (PPE).    The directive also addresses the ongoing stewardship and conservation of the current level of PPE supplies as the government aggressively pursues all available efforts to increase this supply to ensure the appropriate health and safety control measures are in place to mitigate the transmission of infections. A joint statement from the province, the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the ONA can be found here.

Quick Facts

As part of Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, the province is investing $75 million to supply personal protective equipment and critical medical supplies to frontline staff.
A new website, Ontario Together, will help the government partner with Ontario’s manufacturing sector to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak and redirect resources towards the production of essential equipment such as ventilators, masks and swabs.
Everyone in Ontario should stay home unless absolutely necessary and practice physical distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. Avoid close contact (within 2 metres) with people outside of your immediate families.
If you think you may have COVID-19 symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has it, first self-isolate and then use Ontario's Self-Assessment Tool to see if you need to seek further care.

Ontario Protecting Seniors During the COVID-19 Outbreak 
Province Investing $10 Million to Mobilize Businesses and Volunteers to Support the Most Vulnerable 

March 30, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is working with businesses, volunteer organizations and non-profits to make it easier for Ontario's seniors to self-isolate and practice physical distancing during this unprecedented time by ensuring they can receive the support they need to stay safe and healthy. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health is strongly urging those over the age of 70 or those with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions to stay at home.
The government is investing $10 million to help community organizations with the coordination of subsidized deliveries of meals, medicines and other necessities to seniors. This investment doubles the government's initial commitment in Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. The government is also working with grocers and pharmacists to prioritize seniors' delivery orders and establish senior-only shopping hours. ""We take seriously the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and we're working to put an iron ring of protection around our seniors from COVID-19,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""I know asking our seniors to stay at home will not be easy as it will mean inconvenience, isolation and significant change in routine. That's why we are encouraging everyone to reach out and support them, whether it's delivering their prescriptions or picking up the phone and giving them a call. It will all make a positive difference to our most vulnerable citizens."" The government is also working with province-wide organizations including Ontario Community Support Association (OCSA) and Older Adults Centres' Association of Ontario (OACAO) to identify and mobilize potential volunteer supports and expand the use of innovative technologies in the community to address social isolation and support daily living assistance. ""Our seniors have dedicated their lives to making Ontario the great province it is today. During this very difficult period, we need to take every step possible to protect them and ensure they stay healthy both physically and mentally,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""I encourage everyone to stay in regular contact with a parent, grand parent or neighbour to make sure they have everything they need."" This $10 million delivery coordination program for seniors living at home is in addition to the $20 million over two years the province has invested to protect seniors in retirement homes through increased infection control and active screening procedures and $243 million for long-term care homes to support 24/7 screening, additional staffing, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, and additional surge capacity. ""We must do everything in our power to care for and support Ontario's most vulnerable population,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""I want to assure you that we are working around the clock to assist and care for Ontario's seniors, especially those in long-term care, during this unprecedented time."" The government is implementing a new emergency order to ensure that staffing and resources are available to help care for and protect long-term care residents, providing further flexibility and allowing homes to redirect their staffing and financial resources to essential tasks. This is in addition to implementing a new approach to redeploying highly qualified inspectors to support long-term care homes on the ground through staff supply, care coordination, and helping homes prevent and contain infections.  ""It's never been more important that all Ontarians heed the advice of our Chief Medical Officer of Health by staying home and practicing physical distancing,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""This is especially true because it's the only way to protect our seniors and the most vulnerable people in our province. All of us need to do our part to stop the spread of this virus.""

Statement from the Chief Medical Officer of Health


March 30, 2020 12:40 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Today, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, issued the following statement in response to COVID-19:
""The Government of Ontario continues to take decisive action to respond to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) to help contain its spread and to protect the public. This has involved some unprecedented measures, and I know many of you continue to undertake great efforts to protect your families, friends, neighbours, clients and patients, and communities. However, we must do more. Everyone has a role to play in reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19 - there is no option for anyone to opt out. The lives of many Ontarians, especially our community's most vulnerable citizens, are in your hands and will depend on your actions over the coming days and weeks. I strongly recommend you and other members of your household stay home except for essential reasons, such as to: Access health care services;Shop for groceries;Pick-up medication at the pharmacy;Walk pets when required; andSupport vulnerable community members with meeting the above needs.To the fullest extent possible, you should also limit the number of these essential trips. However, when you are out in public you must adhere to physical distancing by reducing your exposure to other people outside of your household by keeping two metres from other people.  Given the greater risk of severe outcomes to Ontarians who are elderly, I am also strongly recommending that individuals over 70 years of age self-isolate. This means only leaving home or seeing other people for essential reasons. Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands. This also applies to individuals who have compromised immune systems and/or underlying medical conditions. As we have been saying repeatedly, it is critically important to wash your hands regularly (or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available), practice proper cough and sneeze etiquette, and avoid direct contact when greeting people.   In addition, as previously communicated and mandated by the federal government, all individuals who are returning from travel outside of Canada must self-isolate for 14 days when they return. You must not go to work, grocery stores or on walks. You should also monitor yourself for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days after returning and contact your primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) if you experience symptoms of COVID-19. I also ask that family members, individuals, neighbours, and services in our communities look at how they can support others by taking these necessary actions. This would allow seniors, other at-risk populations, and returning travellers to remain at home. The government is continuing to support all of the dedicated health care providers and front-line workers who are focused on keeping Ontarians healthy and safe.  We need to remember that we all have an obligation to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 to our families, friends, neighbours, and communities. Please do not underestimate the impact that your actions will have in helping to stop the spread of this virus. For more information on COVID-19, including the current status of the outbreak, the online self-assessment tool to help determine how to seek further care, how Ontario is responding, and how to self isolate, please visit Ontario's COVID-19 web page. Thank you for your ongoing action and commitment.""

""We will continue to work with Public Health Ontario, public health units and the health sector to have and report on the best possible data to help us understand the scope of the COVID-19 outbreak in our province and inform our collective response to keep all Ontarians safe and healthy."" The daily summary is based on data recorded by local public health units in the province's integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), as of 4 p.m. the day before the summary is posted. iPHIS is the Ministry of Health's disease reporting system, where data is regularly updated. In addition to the daily update to the website, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, and Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Associate Chief Medical Officer of Health, will continue to hold regularly scheduled daily media briefings via teleconference, to provide an update on the province's ongoing response to COVID-19.
