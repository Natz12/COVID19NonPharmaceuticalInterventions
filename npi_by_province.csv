YELLOWKNIFE 10 March 2020 – The Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) would like to provide an update to NWT residents on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

As of March 10, 2020 no one in the NWT has tested positive for COVID-19. To date, 24 tests have been performed.

Findings from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Report showed that of over 70,000 people with COVID-19, 80% reported having a mild illness. Another 20% required hospitalization, of which an even smaller amount of people became critically sick. These individuals tended to be adults over 60 years of age or individuals with chronic diseases or weakened immune systems. Those under age 20 tend to have mild illness and represented only 2% of all known cases in this report.

The global picture of COVID-19 transmission is evolving quickly. However, the risk of acquiring COVID-19 within NWT remains low at present. As of this morning, there are 79 confirmed cases in 4 provinces with one reported death. There is also evidence of community transmission in British Columbia, where cases are no longer linked to direct travel to an affected area or contact to someone who has traveled to an affected area.

The NWT Office of the Chief Public Health Officer is working closely with partners at all government levels to protect the health and safety of NWT residents. This now involves testing residents and visitors for COVID-19 if they show flu-like symptoms and have recently travelled outside the NWT within the past 14 days. They will be requested to self-isolate until results are available. If a person should test positive for COVID-19, health officials will act quickly to identify and monitor the person’s contacts to prevent further spread.

Community-level transmission of COVID-19 in the United States and more recently in British Columbia is a reminder that this is possible in the NWT, and that the situation can change quickly. We have developed an NWT COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Guide and checklist for the health system to guide the review of local, regional and territorial pandemic plans. GNWT officials have also reached out to communities, schools, daycare, day homes and the college, as well as Indigenous governments on actions being taken to prepare for COVID-19.  The GNWT will continue to share new information with them to help in their preparedness efforts.

NWT residents have an important role to play to prevent the spread of infection within our communities. Residents should practice good etiquette for coughing or sneezing, frequently wash hands (or use hand sanitizers), stay home when ill, cleaning contaminated surfaces and contacting their local health unit if they have concerns. These actions are effective for preventing the spread of COVID-19 and other common respiratory illnesses such as the flu, common cold and RSV.

At this time the CPHO is advising residents to take the following proactive measures to protect themselves and their communities until further notice:

Adults over 60 years of age, individuals with chronic conditions or weakened immune systems are at increased risk of severe outcomes. They should:
Avoid travelling outside of the NWT
Avoid receiving travelers if possible from affected areas and
Avoid close contact with people who have flu-like symptoms (fever, cough shortness of breath)
Everyone should avoid cruise ship travel.
If you are returning from outside of the NWT, monitor yourself and your family members for symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing for 14 days after your return from travel. If you or your family member develop symptoms, call your healthcare provider ahead of time so that they can arrange assessment and testing. When you arrive at a health care facility, you will be asked to wear a mask so you can protect others.
Employers may want to reconsider non-essential work travel for staff outside of NWT, especially if traveling to affected areas or if attending meetings that receive travelers from affected areas.
If you plan on traveling for personal reasons, check the Government of Canada for the latest travel alerts. If there is community spread of COVID 19 where you are visiting or if you are receiving visitors from an affected area, this will increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19.
If you and your family have visited Iran or Hubei Province, China in the last 14 days, you and your family must self-isolate for 14 days since your last day in those regions, even if you are feeling well. Self-isolation means staying home and not going outside. If you or a family member develops fever, cough, or difficulty breathing during your self-isolation, call your health care provider ahead of time so that they can arrange a visit.
Remember, this advice can change quickly so it is important to monitor the Department’s public website for the latest information.

Just like preparing for weather, ferry and ice road closures, you should have a plan in place that includes keeping 2 weeks of household supplies such as food, water, cleaning supplies, and medication, plus requirements for childcare or elder support.
Finally, NWT organizers of events and gatherings are advised to assess their plans recognizing the COVID-19 outbreak is an evolving situation in Canada and the NWT. As such, the Chief Public Health Officer may direct actions to protect the health and well-being of residents, including cancelling or modifying events or gatherings.

Yellowknife — March 12, 2020Ministers' Statements and Speeches
Mr. Speaker, today I wish to give well deserved recognition to Team Northwest Territories who were scheduled to compete at the 2020 Arctic Winter Games in Whitehorse, Yukon from March 15 -21.

At the same time as providing this recognition, we, of course, have to acknowledge the profound disappointment at the difficult but necessary decision to cancel the 2020 Arctic Winter Games due to the risk presented by the COVID-19 virus. The decision to cancel the games could not have been an easy one, but ultimately, doing what was in the best interests of the health and safety of all those involved had to be the priority.

Mr. Speaker, it is truly unfortunate that there will be no games. Team NT still deserves our thanks and our recognition. Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide Members with some information about Team NT:

At the Territorial Trials, 746 athletes, coaches and chaperones from 23 NWT communities competed for the opportunity to represent the NWT. Of this 344 were female participants and 402 were male participants.

The 2020 Arctic Winter Games Team consists of 355 participants including athletes, coaches and mission staff from 20 different communities. In addition, 17 officials from across the NWT were scheduled to be involved. Team NT athletes were set to compete in all 20 sports.  Team NT also included a cultural contingent that was going to celebrate our cultural heritage.

17 NWT Youth Ambassadors, with representation from all regions in the Territory, were also set to go to Whitehorse as volunteers. The NWT Youth Ambassador Program (NWT YAP) has been in operation in the Northwest Territories for 12 years, and offers a guided and structured volunteer experience for NWT youth at major territorial, national and international events. Participants have the opportunity to develop life and job skills as well as to build the confidence necessary to deal with complex life challenges.

Mr. Speaker,  everyone who is part of Team NT and the contingent who was going to the Arctic Winter games had worked hard for many months and in some cases years to prepare for these games. Team NT is built with the collaboration of so many people who deserve our thanks: Volunteers, sport organizations, and the tireless efforts of parents. I want to say thank you to everyone for all their efforts in the early morning drives, the long hours of practice, and the lessons in fair play and determination. We know the life lessons that involvement in sports teaches are very valuable. What we hope our young people take away from this difficult lesson is that the reward and pride in accomplishment is in the journey.   

Mr. Speaker, I want to advise Members that Team NT will be refunded for their deposits and to keep their uniforms. Unfortunately, due to the scope and magnitude that goes into planning events of this type, postponing the games or holding alternative events is not an option. 

To close, I would like to extend my thanks to Mr. Doug Rentmeister, Chef de Mission, Mr. Damon Crossman and Mr. Bill Othmer, Assistant Chef de Missions for Team NT  and all the rest of their mission staff as well as the Sport North Federation.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.",

Good afternoon, I’m here to talk to the residents of the Northwest Territories about COVID-19.

Earlier today I was absent in the house, and session, to participate on a call from 11 o’clock to 1 o’clock with the Prime Minister and all Premiers across Canada. All Premiers are concerned about COVID-19, and we are all taking precautionary measures to limit the spread and associated impacts throughout Canada.

The particular vulnerabilities of the Northwest Territories, and indeed all three territories, related to rates of overcrowding, limited health infrastructure and services in small and remote communities were emphasized on this phone call and recognized by our Prime Minister as an area in need of support.

Right now we have zero diagnosed cases in the Northwest Territories, but it’s not a matter of if it hits, but when it hits. When it hits, we are emphasizing to Ottawa that we will have special need of support.

All Premiers have committed to working together and updating each other on the status of COVID-19 in their jurisdictions on a regular basis. The Prime Minister has committed to special measures for the North, recognizing our special need.",

Good afternoon. We all know in the coming weeks that there will be new challenges presented here in the Northwest Territories, both for our residents and for the health care system. I want to assure you that we are prepared, and are continuing to prepare.

Knowing that our health system faces unique challenges in the North, we’ve been at an active state of readiness for weeks. We’ve been making necessary preparations to address a surge in the number of NWT residents needing to receive health services in the coming weeks and months because of COVID-19.

We have also been carrying out comprehensive public health surveillance measures, at times going above and beyond what was being recommended by the federal government. This is because we know our best defence in managing the COVID-19 situation is in doing all we can to reduce the likelihood of having it transmitted in our communities.

I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the dedication and professionalism of the frontline and support staff of the health and social services system. I know staff are strongly committed to ensuring the health of NWT residents. And I know we’ll soon be entering a time when, over coming weeks and months, we will need to call upon staff to continue to support the health system and the delivery of health services to residents, in ways that will require new levels of sacrifice when it comes to work-life balance and spending time with family and friends.

I want to reassure residents that the risk of getting COVID-19 in the NWT is low at this time. However, in the coming weeks and months, I would like to call on the media to support the health system by playing a key role in helping residents stay up to date on the latest and accurate health information provided by our Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Kami Kandola.",

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 14 March 2020 – To limit the spread of COVID-19, Global Affairs Canada is advising citizens to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. Further to this advice, the Chief Public Health Officer is recommending that NWT residents avoid all non-essential travel outside of the Northwest Territories.

More information on the Government of Canada’s Travel Advice:

Official Global Travel Advisory
Travellers arriving in the NWT
Further to the above recommendation, if you are arriving in Canada from Hubei province in China, Iran or Italy, you must self-isolate and stay at home for 14 days and contact your health care provider within 24 hours of arriving in Canada.

For all other travellers returning to the NWT, you should self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days. You will need to:

Monitor your health for fever, cough or difficulty breathing.
Wash your hands often for 20 seconds and cover your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing.
If you do develop symptoms within 14 days continue to isolate yourself from others, call your health care provider and inform them about symptoms and travel history. They will provide advice on what you should do.

You can contact a health care provider as follows:

Yellowknife: 867-767-9120, or book online at www.nthssa.ca/appointments
Inuvik: 867-490-2225
Fort Smith: 867-621-2233 or 867-872-0562
Hay River: 867-874-7201 (between 08:30-16.30). After hours call Emergency Department at 867-874-8050.
Other Communities can call their local health centres, www.hss.gov.nt.ca/health-centres
If your symptoms become severe call 9-1-1.

Residents leaving the NWT
Making the choice to stay at home and to not travel outside of the NWT is the best way to protect yourself, your family, and our communities from the spread of COVID-19, and to support our health system in responding to this pandemic.

If you have plans to travel, you should consider contacting your airline or tour operator to determine options for cancelling or postponing your trip.

Residents outside of Canada should find out what commercial options are still available to return to Canada and should consider returning to Canada earlier than planned if these options are becoming limited.

Although not advised, if you are still considering travel outside of Canada, you should do the following:

check your destination before travelling
know the health risks for your destination
understand the risks of your safety and security abroad
ensure that you have sufficient finances and necessities, including medication, in case your travels are disrupted
be prepared if airlines revise scheduled flights to and from your destination
If you travel abroad, you could be subject to the measures of other countries. Your scheduled trip may become much longer. You may also have reduced access to quality health care and your travel health insurance will likely not provide coverage in a pandemic.

The Chief Public Health Officer would also like to reiterate that you should avoid all travel on cruise ships due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, until further notice.

Further, to ensure continuity of health and social services, there has been a strong recommendation made to staff that they cancel all personal travel outside the NWT cancelled effective today.",

Yellowknife — March 14, 2020Media Advisory
The top priority for the Government of the Northwest Territories  (GNWT) is the health and safety of Northwest Territories (NWT) residents, and we are taking proactive measure to be prepared to respond to COVID-19 as the situation evolves.

There are currently no cases of COVID-19 in the NWT, and the risk of acquiring the virus in the NWT and Canada remains low at this time.

Below is an at-a-glance update on the situation in the NWT as it currently stands. The GNWT is committed to providing updates in a consistent and timely manner and will be providing daily updates to media via email and will implement a weekly media briefing. The Health and Social Services website will also continue to be updated regularly and remains your best source for accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19.

 

At-a-Glance Update:

Health:

The GNWT recognizes that our health system faces unique Northern challenges in these types of emergency situations, and as a result have been in an active state of readiness for weeks - making the necessary preparations to address the anticipated surge in the number of NWT residents needing to receive health services in the coming weeks and months because of COVID-19.
The NWT Chief Public Health Officer increased NWT surveillance to include testing anyone (residents and visitors) who arrives from outside of the NWT and show flu or cold like symptoms within 14 days of their arrival to test for COVID-19.  Having this enhanced surveillance allows for the identification and management of any cases early, thereby reducing the strain on our health care system.
Health care providers are on alert to identify and manage possible cases in the NWT, as well as share healthy respiratory practices on an ongoing basis.
Ensuring the continuity of critical government services and programs during a territorial emergency is the responsibility of each GNWT department. Departments have been proactively identifying which services are critical, and putting plans to support their continuation if impacted as this situation evolves.
Emergency Measures

The Emergency Management Office (EMO) coordinates the GNWT response in emergencies and is monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely to identify emergency preparedness needs of communities and potential impacts to communities and critical infrastructure. The EMO has been activated to coordinate a broader emergency response. A communications working group has been established to support this group to ensure the public has timely and accurate information.  
Residents may notice enhanced signage and prominence of hand hygiene stations at our health facilities. This is for the safety of residents, staff, and patients. Visitors to facilities may be asked screening questions to ensure we are protecting patients at acute care sites and residents at long term care facilities. Residents who are currently experiencing illness or who meet the criteria for self-isolation must call for advice regarding treatment options before presenting to a facility. For more information visit the Health and Social Services website.
Education

Education, Culture and Employment has met with education bodies who are prepared to put their contingency plans in place for school closures should the Chief Public Health Officer direct this action.
Tourism

Industry, Tourism and Investment is working with NWT Tourism to communicate with licenced tourism operators across the NWT, and have provided information about COVID-19 from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer to them – and to their guests.
Human Resources

As one of the NWT’s largest employers, the GNWT is committed to supporting our employees and their families as we are all faced with this ever-changing situation.  Regardless of their current leave balances, all employees will be able to access sick and/or special leave to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 on their families, if required.
All duty and work related travel outside of the territory for GNWT employees has been cancelled or suspended. Employees can make use of our Employee Family Assistance Program, as required.
This situation is evolving quickly. The GNWT is confident it is taking all the necessary preparedness steps to ensure the health and safety of NWT residents, and will continue to provide updates.

There are currently no cases of COVID-19 in the NWT, and the risk of acquiring the virus in the NWT and Canada remains low at this time.

Below is an at-a-glance update on the situation in the NWT as it currently stands. The GNWT is committed to providing updates in a consistent and timely manner and will be providing daily updates to media via email and will implement a weekly media briefing. The Health and Social Services website will also continue to be updated regularly and remains your best source for accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19.

 

At-a-Glance Update:

Health:

The GNWT recognizes that our health system faces unique Northern challenges in these types of emergency situations, and as a result have been in an active state of readiness for weeks - making the necessary preparations to address the anticipated surge in the number of NWT residents needing to receive health services in the coming weeks and months because of COVID-19.
The NWT Chief Public Health Officer increased NWT surveillance to include testing anyone (residents and visitors) who arrives from outside of the NWT and show flu or cold like symptoms within 14 days of their arrival to test for COVID-19.  Having this enhanced surveillance allows for the identification and management of any cases early, thereby reducing the strain on our health care system.
Health care providers are on alert to identify and manage possible cases in the NWT, as well as share healthy respiratory practices on an ongoing basis.
Ensuring the continuity of critical government services and programs during a territorial emergency is the responsibility of each GNWT department. Departments have been proactively identifying which services are critical, and putting plans to support their continuation if impacted as this situation evolves.
Emergency Measures

The Emergency Management Office (EMO) coordinates the GNWT response in emergencies and is monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely to identify emergency preparedness needs of communities and potential impacts to communities and critical infrastructure. The EMO has been activated to coordinate a broader emergency response. A communications working group has been established to support this group to ensure the public has timely and accurate information.  
Residents may notice enhanced signage and prominence of hand hygiene stations at our health facilities. This is for the safety of residents, staff, and patients. Visitors to facilities may be asked screening questions to ensure we are protecting patients at acute care sites and residents at long term care facilities. Residents who are currently experiencing illness or who meet the criteria for self-isolation must call for advice regarding treatment options before presenting to a facility. For more information visit the Health and Social Services website.
Education

Education, Culture and Employment has met with education bodies who are prepared to put their contingency plans in place for school closures should the Chief Public Health Officer direct this action.
Tourism

Industry, Tourism and Investment is working with NWT Tourism to communicate with licenced tourism operators across the NWT, and have provided information about COVID-19 from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer to them – and to their guests.
Human Resources

As one of the NWT’s largest employers, the GNWT is committed to supporting our employees and their families as we are all faced with this ever-changing situation.  Regardless of their current leave balances, all employees will be able to access sick and/or special leave to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 on their families, if required.
All duty and work related travel outside of the territory for GNWT employees has been cancelled or suspended. Employees can make use of our Employee Family Assistance Program, as required.
This situation is evolving quickly. The GNWT is confident it is taking all the necessary preparedness steps to ensure the health and safety of NWT residents, and will continue to provide updates.

Visitors to facilities may be asked screening questions to ensure we are protecting patients at acute care sites and residents at long term care facilities. Residents who are currently experiencing illness or who meet the criteria for self-isolation must call for advice regarding treatment options before presenting to a facility. For more information visit the Health and Social Services website.
Education

Education, Culture and Employment has met with education bodies who are prepared to put their contingency plans in place for school closures should the Chief Public Health Officer direct this action.
Tourism

Industry, Tourism and Investment is working with NWT Tourism to communicate with licenced tourism operators across the NWT, and have provided information about COVID-19 from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer to them – and to their guests.
Human Resources

As one of the NWT’s largest employers, the GNWT is committed to supporting our employees and their families as we are all faced with this ever-changing situation.  Regardless of their current leave balances, all employees will be able to access sick and/or special leave to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 on their families, if required.
All duty and work related travel outside of the territory for GNWT employees has been cancelled or suspended. Employees can make use of our Employee Family Assistance Program, as required.
This situation is evolving quickly. The GNWT is confident it is taking all the necessary preparedness steps to ensure the health and safety of NWT residents, and will continue to provide updates.

Yellowknife — March 16, 2020Ministers' Statements and Speeches
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the members of this Assembly for taking the step of suspending its current sitting after today to allow Cabinet and the public service greater opportunity to prepare for the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

Although there remains no reported case in the NWT, our government continues to prepare for the impact of this pandemic.  Hour to hour, we are monitoring the state of the COVID-19 situation as it continues to evolve. I want to share with the Assembly some of the actions and planning that is underway.

Our health system has been preparing over the last few months, as the concern over this new virus became known. This planning has included securing additional supplies and preparing staff and facilities to respond to an outbreak.

Our health officials have also been working with partners - including the Government of Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada – to stay current with the most recent information and recommendations about this disease. 

Based on these discussions, our Chief Public Health Officer has been working tirelessly with her colleagues to provide the best available advice to officials and the public about how to identify and care for those infected and prevent the spread of this disease.

One thing we know is that we can slow the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact on our communities if everyone follows the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer, and takes the necessary precautions to protect themselves and most importantly to safeguard those who may be more vulnerable including our elders.

We are fortunate that our health system has not yet had to face any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the NWT, but we know that this virus is spreading and we all need to take personal steps to slow the spread of this illness. By slowing the rate of infection, our health system will be better able to effectively respond to this pandemic.  

On Friday, our Health and Social Services Minister thanked our many health care professionals for their dedication and service, and Mr. Speaker on behalf of all of us here in this assembly, and on behalf of the people of the Northwest Territories, I want to also thank them for their efforts to look after us all. We know their work will become more challenging as the COVID-19 virus continues to spread.   

Over the weekend, we have also taken the extraordinary step of asking our health care professionals to avoid any unnecessary travel outside of the NWT. This will prevent exposure and help avoid the potential requirements for isolation and will ensure that the NWT health system can maintain as much operational readiness as possible to manage the spread of this disease.

Mr. Speaker, work to prepare for a COVID-19 pandemic in the Northwest Territories began even before the World Health Organization declared one. In addition to the measures our health system has put in place to identify, prevent and control the spread of infectious disease, our Government also has dedicated resources and procedures to manage emergencies.

Our Department of Municipal and Community Affairs includes the Emergency Management Organization established under the Emergency Management Act. Its role is, in part, to lead the Government of the Northwest Territories in the coordination of emergency management activities, support emergency management activities of local authorities, and coordinate and assist in the response of governments and public agencies.

The head of the Emergency Management Office also chairs the Territorial Planning Committee that works with community governments and other key partners to ensure readiness, and to respond to emergencies. 

Again, although we have yet to face a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the NWT, we have taken the proactive step of activating an Emergency Operations Centre under MACA’s leadership as of March 13, 2020 and work will continue to assist all communities in the NWT to help prevent or manage any COVID-19 outbreak.

Mr. Speaker, later this week I will also be convening a virtual meeting with community governments and Indigenous governments to share the latest information we have on our readiness and our plans. We will continue to meet regularly with them to work together to eliminate any gaps in our plans and support our efforts. 

We know that many communities and jurisdictions in Canada and throughout the world have made the decision to temporarily close schools as result of this pandemic. The Minister of Education, Culture and Employment has consulted with the Chief Public Health Officer on this, and has received the advice today to close NWT schools until after Easter. Later today, the Minister will be convening a teleconference with all District Education Authorities to discuss this direction and how best to support school teachers, staff and students as they return from Spring Break travel.

Mr. Speaker, as we prepare for this pandemic, the health and safety of our people is paramount. Every GNWT department and agency has been tasked with identifying and planning for the continuation of essential services. If a large number of our employees are required to self-isolate to prevent the further spread of the virus, we know that government services may face a significant disruption. It is critical that key services remain supported, and we are taking the proper steps to deal with a scenario where we have dramatically fewer available employees.

All departments and agencies have been updating their Business Continuity Plans and later this week these plans will be finalized, and validated with table top exercises to ensure potential gaps have been identified and can be addressed. We know that the work of our government touches upon the lives of the people we serve in important ways, and that we need to make sure that there is as little disruption as possible should we find that many of our employees have to be isolated to care for themselves or others. Our planning will also consider how best to manage the NWT supply chain to help ensure that residents and businesses continue to receive essential services.

Mr. Speaker, it is important to state again that the NWT has no reported cases of COVID-19 and that the risk of contracting the disease in the NWT remains low today.  This does not mean that we can rest easy. We must be prepared to take preventative actions now.

In recent days, we have seen many jurisdictions implement new measures in response to having the virus already spreading within their borders. We have the ability to take measures sooner than others to better manage the risk. This will mean some disruption in travel for residents coming home who will need to self-isolate, and tourists who will have to postpone their visits the NWT.

It is critically important that all residents of, and visitors to, the NWT take precautions and follow the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer. As our preparations continue it is also critical that our community partners work with MACA’s Emergency Operations Centre to ensure plans are in place, and that every effort is made to minimize the risk and manage the impacts of this pandemic.  

We are implementing the best approaches available to slow and manage the spread of COVID-19. While we must not panic, we do have to take precautions.

I want to thank all residents of the Northwest Territories for their understanding as we direct more of the work of our government to managing this issue, and acknowledge that some of this effort will necessarily come at the expense of other priorities. However, protecting our most vulnerable from this pandemic is our most important priority, and we are working closely with our service providers to develop plans.

Mr. Speaker, we know that the consequences of this pandemic are already having an impact on our economy, and that many of our residents and businesses will need support. These concerns have been raised with the Prime Minister, and I am very encouraged that there is clearly recognition that new federal programs and investments will be required to protect our economy. Additional options to provide support to our residents and businesses are being actively considered.   

Information on the spread of this new virus and knowledge of how best to manage its impacts has been changing rapidly. That is why we are working closely with our partners from across all jurisdictions to stay up to date on the latest information. We will be providing daily reports and have set up a single portal for more information at www.gov.nt.ca and click on the corona virus feature box. The website is being updated as new information becomes available.

We recognize that people are concerned, but I want to remind everbody that we can all take practical steps to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. We will continue to update our residents, our communities, and Indigenous government partners, and I strongly urge everybody to check our website frequently and heed the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer and our Emergency Management Office as we work together to safeguard our friends, families and our elders.

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 17 March 2020 – To limit the spread of COVID-19, the Government of NWT is advising all individuals, organizations, and businesses that they should cancel all mass gatherings which could reach over 50 people.

Large retail or grocery stores are exempt from the 50 person-requirement. The remaining guidance on hand-washing and physical distance still apply.  

Additionally, if you are holding a gathering of less than 50 people, the following measures must be available to be considered safe:

The ability to keep two metres between people.
Adequate supply of hygiene material (i.e. paper towels, soap, hand sanitizer, running water, waste disposal).
The direction that anyone who is not feeling well must stay home.
Increased cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces used often.
Remember: hosting gatherings outdoors is always safer.

Objective of Advice
Large gatherings are a significant source of spread. Physical distancing of more than two metres apart becomes challenging, healthy respiratory practices may not always be followed, and more bodies mean more chance of spread. Taking action to limit large gatherings will help protect all Northwest Territories residents — and especially the elderly and other vulnerable populations.

Who Can I Contact For More Advice?
If you’re looking to host a gathering and you are unsure whether yours will be safe, you can contact covid@gov.nt.ca for advice.

The email address is monitored regularly from 8:30 AM – 5:00 PM, Monday to Friday. Public Health staff will get back to you with advice as soon as they can.

Yellowknife — March 18, 2020News Releases
As of 12:00pm today, the Minister of Health and Social Services, Diane Thom, has declared a territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories Public Health Act in response to  the COVID-19 global pandemic to protect public health in the Northwest Territories.

The Public Health Emergency was declared upon the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola, and is in effect from March 18 through April 1.

The purpose of calling an emergency is to allow the Chief Public Health Officer to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily-evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic.

At this time, Dr. Kandola is focusing efforts on controlling the spread over the next 60 days. This is the most crucial period as the territory works to slow spread, flatten the curve, and keep our residents safe.

The public health emergency covers the entirety of the Northwest Territories and will provide expanded powers to the Chief Public Health Officer to:

authorize qualified people to provide additional aid and services as needed;
expedite emergency licensing of additional health care providers;
make orders and provide directions restricting or prohibiting travel to or from any area within the Northwest Territories;
coordinate and provide for the delivery of medical services;
procure and provide for the distribution of medical supplies and equipment across the NWT;
Under the Act, Public Health Emergencies may last up-to 14 days. However, if the risk to public health remains, the Minister may re-declare a Public Health Emergency, as often as necessary.

 

Quick facts

Under a Public Health Emergency, the Chief Public Health Officer may take any reasonable measure considered necessary to protect public health.
This could include making Orders — legally binding direction — to individuals and organizations including businesses, governments, agencies, and non-profit groups to respond to a Public Health Emergency.
Examples of Orders could be that individuals self-isolate, businesses enact emergency measures to alleviate health risks, or major changes be made to traffic incoming in the territory.
Quotes

“This is the right step to take to protect all Northwest Territories residents from the spread of COVID-19. Nothing is off-the-table when it comes to keeping our residents safe, and our healthcare system strong. We urge all residents to do their part by following all advice from healthcare professionals every single day, and supporting each other as we all change our lifestyles in response to the pandemic. All residents should keep informed on the latest health information, and stay calm while we rise to this challenge together. ”

Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services
“My advice to the Minister of Health and Social Services comes from the latest medical information across the country, and a careful consideration of the Northwest Territories’ unique situation. We are working around the clock — public health, nurses, doctors, and frontline staff — to address the spread of COVID-19. We are continuing to move forward with one of the most aggressive testing regimes in the country, tracking contact history of all possible patients, and taking appropriate action to reduce contact with others. Remember: our best defense against this virus is each other. If you’re sick, stay home, avoid contact with others, and call your local public health or healthcare centre. Wash your hands — a lot. Keep at least two metres between yourself and others.”

Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Public Health Officer

It was only eight days ago, last Thursday, that the Legislative Assembly was part way through our winter budget session. Eight days ago the full Assembly came together, took stock of the growing risks of the COVID-19 pandemic and took action by deciding to end our winter session early. This past Monday, all 19 members of the Assembly supported the passage of an interim appropriation to provide a temporary budget for the functioning of the Government of the NWT until we can reconvene at the end of May.

The use of an interim appropriation might was the first step in our financial response to COVID-19. Those initial steps and further items are what I am going to outline briefly today. In these last few days, we have identified several other initiatives that we can take immediately to help support the financial health of our residents and businesses. What we are describing today is only phase 1. This has been a whole-of government effort including FIN, INF, ITI, ECE, MACA, NTPC and the WSCC. We are all working together to identify ways to help put money in the hands of people who need it for groceries,  and businesses who are trying to keep their payroll going.

This spirit of everyone working together applies to the private sector as well. There are many businesses continuing to provide services: plumbers and mechanics, drive through restaurants, grocers, water and sewage trucks, and supply chain transport and logistics. I believe they are all doing their best to follow the advice of the CPHO while also working hard to keep our communities running. I also want to acknowledge efforts from different sectors to at least temporarily reduce or remove fees, including the ongoing ask from NWTel to the CRTC. I want to encourage everyone to keep being creative and thinking of others during these unprecedented events.

With that, I want to describe this first wave of initiatives that provide an equivalent of at least $13.2m worth of financial supports to the NWT in response to COVID-19:

Interim appropriation budget:

HSS extra 25%: we want our health professionals to know, you are there for all of us and we will be supporting you
615k for dialysis expansion in HR; expansion of regional health services and immediately, that means an injection of 615k to the HSS budget
ECE extra 25%, now set $2m for IA expecting a growth in demand and need; short term is going to be hard, we know that, and we have planned for it
100% almost all dept’s grants and contribution funding ready to go out April 1
IGs, Community governments and NGOS will have access to their full 12 months worth of funding upfront on April 1
100% of almost all contracting available for departments to commit as of April 1
Departments can commit to all of our business and community partners relying on the full 12 months worth of funds
Additional initiatives:

We will allow carry overs for all 2019-2020 contributions
IGs, CG and NGOs with money in their 2019-20 budgets can continue to use those funds for their ongoing operations
advance royalty payments to devolution signatory Indigenous Governments
Usually the payment is made in July once the previous year’s royalties are fully reported
Advance 50% of the anticipated royalties from 2019-2020 now
IGs can provide their own direct support to their people and communities
NTPC will remove load limiters and pause collections
Similarly, FIN will also be temporarily pausing collections owed to the GNWT such as payroll tax and ECE will defer all Student Financial Assistance payments until September 30
Next steps

Need to continue to support our most vulnerable
No one should worry about food, mortgages, heat or other basic needs
We will make sure that the Federal financial measures are accessible across communities
And we will look at what further supports GNWT can provide while we all navigate the realities of a global pandemic
We also have our eyes on the hopefully not too distant future and what kinds of steps we will need to take once the wave has crested
As I said in my budget speech last month, this government is going to be creative and collaborative in order to find solutions that are responsive and responsible
That has not changed. If anything, this is our opportunity to put those promises into action.",

I’d like to take a moment to reiterate what many of my colleagues have also addressed over the last few days, and that’s that I know this is an anxious time, and many of us are unsure and worried about what the future holds.

The situation with COVID-19 is evolving quickly, and in times like this, what many people want most are answers. They want to know that their physical, and financial wellbeing are being looked out for. That their governments understand these pressures, and are doing everything they can.

Well, I am here today with Minister Wawzonek to try to ease some of that worry, and reassure you that there are many hardworking, dedicated people working tirelessly to deal with each issue that arises, and protect NWT residents during this uncertain time.  

There is no denying that COVID-19 is a significant challenge around the world, and in the Northwest Territories.  In the North, the global situation will have an immense impact on us.

There is no avoiding the economic impacts that we are already challenged with, but we are committed to doing what we can to help residents, businesses, and our economy during this period of uncertainty.

As Minister Wawzonek has outlined, the GNWT has put together an initial $13.2 Million dollar economic relief package that will take effect immediately.

This funding is intended to work in concert with federal incentives announced under Canada’s $27 billion COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, earlier this week.

We understand the critical importance of maintaining the northern supply chain. The delivery of essential goods must continue in order to resupply our communities, and support our economy.

To help maintain ground-based resupply into the territory, all toll fees for crossing the Deh Cho Bridge and many permit fees for transport trucks on all NWT highways will be waived until June.

To support our airlines, all landing fees at all NWT airports will also be waived.

At the BDIC, we’re going to offer low interest loans to businesses to help offset COVID-19 impacts, and allow the deferral of any BDIC loan payments for a period of up to three months with no penalty or additional interest charges.

As well, we’ll offer an extension of the due date for Employer Assessment Payments with the WSCC from April 1 to May 1, 2020.

We will also establish an Economic Council to help identify the economic impacts, represent the business community, and ensure that the items most critical to local economies and jobs are addressed.

There are a number of other items being implemented, and the full list of GNWT response measures for phase 1, are included in the release.  

I want to reassure residents and our business community that we will continue to look at ways to support you and continue to assess other relief measures, including leaning on the federal government to offer more support to the North.

The Premier and each member of Cabinet will continue to be a voice for our residents and businesses in conversations with our federal counterparts. Addressing the costs, and challenges that we are all experiencing is a priority, and we are committed to keeping you informed along the way.

Before I conclude my statement, I’d like to take a moment to address the concerns about the NWT Diamond Mines, and the decision made by Dominion Diamond Mine to temporarily suspend operations at Ekati, in the interest of mitigating the spread of COVID-19 to the NWT.

This is obviously difficult news to take from the perspective of the NWT economy, and the livelihoods of those that are reliant on Ekati for jobs or business. 

We know that the impacts of COVID-19 are far reaching and that includes our mining industry.

That said, all mines are not equal. Their ownership structure, operations, and their capacity to address issues like COVID-19 is different.

The Diavik and Gacho Kué mines, and other businesses, are also taking steps to address the COVID19 crisis. The fact that they are still operating should not be a reflection of a disregard for what is happening.

I am confident that businesses that are still in operation are adhering to the safety precautions outlined by the Chief Public Health Officer, and are operating within the parameters that have been put in place so far.

Yellowknife — March 20, 2020News Releases
The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT)  recognizes the difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic and health measures being taken to combat the virus’ spread is causing NWT businesses, service providers, residents, governments and non-government organizations. Today, Minister Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance and Minister Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment, and Infrastructure, announced Economic Relief Measures that will help minimize expenses and keep cash available for immediate needs in this time of uncertainty.

The GNWT has put together an initial economic relief package valued at $13.2 Million dollars that will take effect immediately. This package is intended to work in concert with federal incentives under Canada’s $27 billion COVID-19 Economic Response Plan announced earlier this week. 

In addition to this first wave of economic relief announced today by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Industry Tourism and Investment and Infrastructure, the GNWT will continue to identify other relief measures to assist territorial residents and business owners and operators as we respond toCOVID-19.

Quotes

“The GNWT has been able to identify immediate steps we can take to waive fees, ease funding restrictions, and defer payments in order to reduce economic stress on territorial residents and businesses. This is not a time for anyone to worry about bills or payments. Right now we want to ensure that business who provide public services can do so safely and that employees who can stay home do so without worrying about economics. By working together we stand the best chance of reducing the potential for COVID-19 infections in the NWT.” 

- Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance

“We recognize that this is a difficult time for business owners and service providers in the Northwest Territories. In the short term, we will provide necessary financing to small businesses to the extent that we can. In the long term, we will work with the business community to identify a path forward to economic recovery.   We are going to need help from the federal government and we will continue to be a voice for Northwest Territories’ business in discussions addressing the costs and challenges that we are experiencing. In the meantime, I urge residents to do what they can to support local business and service providers.”

- Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment and Infrastructure

Yellowknife — March 20, 2020News Releases
NWT Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola is preparing to make an order effective March 21, 2020 prohibiting all travel (by air, land, and port) into the Northwest Territories, with limited exceptions, to combat COVID-19 in the territory.

 

Furthermore, Dr. Kandola will also order those returning to the territory, to self-isolate in Yellowknife, Fort Smith, Hay River, or Inuvik.     

 

This measure will be required to ensure protection of residents of our smallest communities as people return north.

This order will also require those who have returned to the NWT within the preceding 14 days, to self-isolate in their current community.  All individuals will be required to complete a self-isolation plan.  Further details on this measure will be forthcoming.

 

This is necessary due to the growing risk of COVID-19 as it spreads through throughout Canada, and make it possible to ensure those at risk of COVID-19 due to travel are self-isolating in communities with well-equipped healthcare facilities.

 

Travel through all points of entry into the Northwest Territories — both air and road — will be prohibited to all travelers with the exception of:

NWT residents.
Import/export workers — including those providing important supply chain transportation services for food, equipment, fuel, or other goods into the territory, movers and carriers, and workers that support the supply chain industry.

Workers involved in the construction of GNWT capital infrastructure projects.
Southern resident transient workers in the mineral and petroleum resources industry, and
Persons who cross the NWT border while participating in traditional harvesting or on the land activities and who do not enter any communities as part of this.
Further Guidance and conditions will be issued as part of the order for the following persons:

NWT residents.
Import/export workers — including those providing important supply chain transportation services for food, equipment, fuel, or other goods into the territory, movers and carriers, and workers that support the supply chain industry.
Flight crews.
Persons who support essential services — including those coming to provide childcare or similar support services for essential service workers, and those participating in the COVID-19 response.
When Will It Come Into Force?

It is intended this order will be issued on Saturday, March 21, 2020.  However, it will not be issued until all operation measures are in-place to ensure it is implemented in the most orderly fashion possible.

 

This includes human resource re-deployment, contacts, and processes to triage those who arrive home. Communication materials are also being created to inform those entering by air and road.

 

Updates will be issued with further implementation guidance.

 

This order will be made under the NWT’s Public Health Act, using the additional powers granted to the Chief Public Health Officer during a Public Health Emergency.

 

Information on Enforcement

Under the Public Health Act, the Chief Public Health Officer may require any Peace Officer to actively enforce orders. Disobeying them is punishable by law and may include a fine upon summary conviction of up to $10,000 and six months imprisonment.

 

Upon the issuance of the order, anyone who does not follow these directions will be subject to these penalties.

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 22 March 2020 – To limit the spread of COVID-19, the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) is advising all individuals and organizations that they should cancel all gatherings regardless of size or number of participants or whether they are held inside or outside.

This will include (but not limited to) the following events/groups:

Organized outdoor and indoor events (jamborees, spring festivals, hamlet days, etc)
Religious services/churches (including funerals and weddings)
Recreational facilities/indoors (arenas, pools recreational centre, youth centre, gyms)
Bingos/Chase the Ace
Community centres
The CPHO is also recommending that the following businesses be closed as the nature of their operation will not allow them to have suitable distancing measures in place to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19:

Tour Operators
Bottle Depots
Gyms and fitness centres
Museums and Art galleries
Bars and night clubs
Theatres and movie theatres
Buffet style restaurants
Personal service establishments (barber, hair salons, massage, nail and other salons)
Objective of Advice
The CPHO recommends social distancing of 2 metres to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing means limiting the amount of people you come into contact with, which lowers the risk of passing or catching the virus.

Organized gatherings (indoors or outside) are a source of spread COVID-19. Maintaining a distance of 2 metres significantly reduces the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Businesses that require close contact cannot provide this reduced risk.

Social distancing of more than two metres apart becomes challenging, healthy respiratory practices may not always be followed, and more bodies with more time near each other  means more chance of spread of COVID-19.

Taking action to limit gatherings and these business operations will help protect all Northwest Territories residents — and especially the elderly and other vulnerable populations.

Who Can I Contact For Advice?
If you’re business or event or gathering type is not listed in above you can contact environmental_ health@gov.nt.ca to request advice. Please ensure you provide a phone number, community name and some brief details of your event or business in your request email.

The email address is monitored regularly from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday to Friday. Public health officials will get back to you with advice as soon as they can.

Important Note
If you feel sick, you should not go to any gathering of any size — stay home.

They will talk with you about your symptoms, and advise you what to do next. Do not go in without calling.

If you develop severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing call 9-1-1.

Implications for Businesses
Personal Services Establishments (massage, salons, barbers and tattoo parlors and piercers) should be closed until further notice as they cannot operate and provide for the 2 m separation required to be safe and they by nature require more time than a casual time limited contact. It is recommended businesses that require clients and staff to have close contact (less than two meters) close at this time or take steps to limit how close persons may be to one another.

Essential services large retail stores (groceries, gas bars and convenience stores) can remain open if they can maintain 2m separations between persons within the facility. They should also strongly encourage employees and customers to keep a distance of two metres between each other, including in line-ups, wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds frequently, or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content frequently.

Other essential businesses should wherever possible limit face to face meeting and contact of any kind. Banks, pharmacies, Liquor stores, Gas stations, restaurants and pubs serving food, and coffee shops should if possible operate with 2 m distance, increased hand washing or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content.

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 22 March 2020 – To limit the spread of COVID-19, the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) is advising all individuals and organizations that they should cancel all gatherings regardless of size or number of participants or whether they are held inside or outside.

This will include (but not limited to) the following events/groups:

Organized outdoor and indoor events (jamborees, spring festivals, hamlet days, etc)
Religious services/churches (including funerals and weddings)
Recreational facilities/indoors (arenas, pools recreational centre, youth centre, gyms)
Bingos/Chase the Ace
Community centres
The CPHO is also recommending that the following businesses be closed as the nature of their operation will not allow them to have suitable distancing measures in place to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19:

Tour Operators
Bottle Depots
Gyms and fitness centres
Museums and Art galleries
Bars and night clubs
Theatres and movie theatres
Buffet style restaurants
Personal service establishments (barber, hair salons, massage, nail and other salons)
Objective of Advice
The CPHO recommends social distancing of 2 metres to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing means limiting the amount of people you come into contact with, which lowers the risk of passing or catching the virus.

Organized gatherings (indoors or outside) are a source of spread COVID-19. Maintaining a distance of 2 metres significantly reduces the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Businesses that require close contact cannot provide this reduced risk.

Social distancing of more than two metres apart becomes challenging, healthy respiratory practices may not always be followed, and more bodies with more time near each other  means more chance of spread of COVID-19.

Taking action to limit gatherings and these business operations will help protect all Northwest Territories residents — and especially the elderly and other vulnerable populations.

Yellowknife — March 24, 2020News Releases
Government of the Northwest Territories departments are working together with community governments and other organizations and agencies to monitor and respond to potential threats to public safety, communities and critical infrastructure in the Northwest Territories.

To that effect, an agreement aimed at providing reassurance to Northwest Territories (NWT) residents, and ensure there are no disruptions to electricity services in the North during the COVID-19 pandemic, was signed late last week.

The Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC) signed a mutual aid agreement through the Canadian Electricity Association (CEA).  This will allow NTPC to request aid from other utilities across Canada in the event additional resources are required to maintain or restore power.

ATCO, the main shareholder of Northland Utilities (Yellowknife) Limited and Northland Utilities (NWT) Limited, had previously signed the agreement. NTPC and ATCO have agreed that the CEA agreement will be used to govern any mutual aid required by either organization through the pandemic, and in the future. The strength of both organizations will be available to maintain electricity service across the NWT.

Any assistance that is provided through this agreement will be provided at cost by the company supplying the assistance to the company requiring the assistance.  There will be no costs incurred unless assistance is required.

 

Quotes

“The Government of the Northwest Territories appreciates the cooperation and leadership that is being shown by the two electricity utilities that provide service in our communities. The mutual aid agreement will help ensure that if a power disruption occurs, every available resource can be accessed to get electricity restored as quickly as possible. Thank you to the Northwest Territories Power Corporation and Northland Utilities.

- Shane Thompson, Minister Responsible for the Northwest Territories Power Corporation

“As a small utility, our ability to respond to a significant outage or to maintain operations during a public health emergency can be impeded by the availability of appropriately-trained workers. This agreement ensures that we can reach out to our colleagues for assistance if needed.” 

- Noel Voykin, President and CEO for the Northwest Territories Power Corporation

“Northland Utilities is committed to providing our customers with safe and reliable power, which is of critical importance in these unprecedented times. The Mutual Aid Agreement with the Canadian Electricity Association is built upon a commonly shared dedication across the electricity utility industry in Canada to the customers we serve, and it allows us to draw upon ATCO crews in Alberta and the Northwest Territories to ensure all customers continue to receive power in the midst of a situation such as the current pandemic crisis.
-Melanie Bayley, Senior Vice President & General Manager, Electricity ATCO Group

Yellowknife — March 25, 2020News Releases
Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) R.J. Simpson met with Northwest Territories (NWT) Education Leaders and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) via teleconference on Tuesday, March 24 to discuss the status of JK-12 education in the territory as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency.

Education Leaders included Chairs of the Tłı̨chǫ Community Services Agency, Dettah and Ndilo District Education Authorities (DEAs), the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, Beaufort Delta Education Council, Dehcho Divisional Education Council, South Slave Divisional Education Council, Sahtu Divisional Education Council, Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic Schools, as well as NWTTA President.

Due to the significant health concerns posed by COVID-19 and the importance of following direction from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) on social distancing as a way to keep students, staff and communities safe, Education Leaders have agreed with the recommendation from Minister Simpson that schools be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.

Education Leaders have shared the recommendation with District Education Authorities, who hold the authority under the Education Act to close NWT schools. Closures are being announced individually by respective education councils.

Minister Simpson, Education Leaders and the NWTTA recognize the serious impact school closures will have on students, parents, staff and communities, and have agreed that a plan is required to support continued learning for all students, especially those in Grade 12, to achieve their education and career goals.

ECE continues to meet daily with NWT education superintendents and the NWTTA to discuss support for essential services, continuity of educational programming and ongoing communication. These plans continue to be adjusted as new information and direction is provided by the CPHO.

While the immediate priority is not to provide lessons or give instruction it is necessary to identify and secure essential services for supporting students and communities. All parties share the strong interest of parents and communities in ensuring opportunities for continued learning. The NWTTA has advised that teachers are prepared and willing to help students and communities however they can during this unprecedented time.

ECE will continue to work with the NWTTA and education bodies to find options for providing educational programming to all NWT students, particularly those in Grade 12. This includes reviewing what’s being done in other jurisdictions, especially Alberta, whose curriculum and major assessment tools are used for the majority of NWT education programming.

ECE will also be working to coordinate with post-secondary institutions across Canada in an effort to ensure the smoothest transition possible for those graduating this year. Minister Simpson continues to have weekly calls with Canadian Education Ministers to discuss ways to ensure students graduating high school this year are able to advance to post-secondary institutions.

The continuation of meal programs, along with counselling and other health and wellness programming, have been identified by ECE, the CPHO and education bodies as essential to NWT communities, and work is ongoing to identify which positions and individuals will be involved in providing these programs and services during school closures.

ECE will continue to provide updates to parents, communities and education bodies as plans are developed and implemented.

 

Quote:

“The COVID-19 situation in the Northwest Territories has evolved substantially since the initial closure of schools on March 16. As new public health advisories and orders are put in place, including the declaration of a public health emergency, the closure of the NWT border and the cancellation of all gatherings, we must continue to make difficult decisions to protect the health and safety of our residents. I am grateful to the NWT Education Leaders for their dedication and commitment to ensuring the well-being of our students, staff and communities in deciding to close schools for the remainder of the school year. As Minister, I remain committed to working with our education bodies to provide students and communities with the programs and services they need to succeed throughout this unprecedented time.”

 - Hon. R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment


Quick Facts:

The Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) of the NWT made the recommendation that schools remain closed until after Easter Break as a precautionary measure to minimize the potential spread of COVID-19. 
On March 21, the CPHO issued an order to close the border and require all NWT residents returning from outside the territory to self-isolate for 14 days. This current order from the CPHO applies to all school staff and students returning from travel. A significant number of school employees were out of the territory on spring break when these travel restrictions were ordered, and are therefore currently self-isolating.
ECE and education bodies continue to work together on continuity planning in relation to JK-12 class cancellation. All options for continued provision of educational services, including potential alternative learning plans, are currently being explored.

Yellowknife — March 27, 2020News Releases
Effective March 24, 2020, the Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs (MACA), Paulie Chinna, declared a territory-wide  State of Emergency under the Emergency Management Act to support ongoing efforts to protect public health in the Northwest Territories.

 

This decision does not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to the people of the Northwest Territories.  The need to declare a state of emergency at this time is to make it more efficient to deploy resources to protect residents and enhance our response to the orders made by the Chief Public Health Officer.

This step has been taken to ensure the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) is better able to support the implementation of the orders issued by the Chief Public Health Officer to help slow the spread of COVID-19, and gives the EMO the authority to control and direct all persons, including the GNWT and public agencies involved in emergency management plans or programs under the Emergency Management Act.

 

At this time, all residents are urged to follow these Orders and all other direction and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer.

 

The State of Emergency will be in effect from March 24 through April 7, 2020.

Quotes
“It is really important that the Government of the Northwest Territories does everything it can to support our Chief Public Health Officer. This Order will give us additional authorities to help Dr. Kandola and make sure she is able to do everything she can to protect NWT residents.  Now is a time for us to move forward, calmly and steadily. It is a time for all Northerners to join together and support each other. Follow the advice and directions of health officials and emergency responders. Let’s be kind to one another and, as we have done so many times before, let us come together as a community to face this challenge together.”

Paulie Chinna, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs
“I want to assure the people of the Northwest Territories that all levels of Government are taking this pandemic very seriously, and doing what we can to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Declaring a state of emergency, as many other jurisdictions have, will help ensure that our officials have all the tools they need to do their jobs to protect and care for residents. We will continue to work closely with the Federal government, provinces and territories to ensure coordinated approaches to the pandemic.”

Caroline Cochrane, Premier
Quick Facts
The State of Emergency was declared on the recommendation of the head of the Emergency Management Organization, Ivan Russell.
Declaring a State of Emergency provides additional powers to the Minister and those designated by the Minister to do all acts and take all necessary proceedings, for the duration of the order, to deal with an emergency.
Steps already taken by the GNWT to support the implementation of the public health order include establishing isolation centres and putting measures in place to receive travellers at airports in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River and Fort Smith, and at ground entry points to secure borders in Enterprise, Fort Smith, Liard and Dempster entry points.

Take This Online Self-Assessment For COVID-19 In The Northwest Territories,"Wonder If You Should Call To Get Tested? Take This Online Self-Assessment For COVID-19 In The Northwest Territories
Yellowknife — March 27, 2020Public Service Announcement
The GNWT’s online self-assessment tool for COVID-19 for residents has been completed nearly 2500 times after launching just days ago.

The tool will help assess any symptoms, travel history, and other variables to help you know what you should do to protect yourself and your community. You can complete it for yourself, or you can complete it for someone else. The tool collects no personal information.

Based on the outcome, the assessment tool will give residents information on what they should do next. The tool will let you know if you should be contacting a local health care centre by phone to arrange testing, or if symptoms are severe enough that you should call for emergency help.

The objectives of providing this tool are two-fold:

Give residents peace of mind and clear direction based on their situation, and
Reduce strain on call-in operations and frontline health workers to better serve people across the Northwest Territories.
All residents who can use this tool, or can get help using it, are urged to use the self-assessment tool to help us reach these objectives. Printed versions of the self-assessment are being distributed to health care centres.

Anyone using a self-assessment tool should be aware of what assessment tool they are using. There are many online self-assessment tools available from the federal government and other provinces which do not reflect the Northwest Territories’ aggressive testing strategy.

To get the appropriate information and guidance within the NWT, residents are encouraged to only use the NWT’s online-self assessment tool.

If a person is experiencing severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, call 9-1-1 and do not proceed with the self-assessment tool.",

Yellowknife — March 30, 2020News Releases
Everyone is urged to Protect Our Elders in two new campaigns to combat the spread of COVID-19.

The Northwest Territories Association of Communities (NWTAC), Music NWT, and the GNWT have teamed up to run these campaigns.

Our goal is to build solidarity during the COVID-19 crisis, and get residents to recognize that changing behaviors isn’t just about them – it’s about the people they love, and our most vulnerable community-members.

Protect Our Elders: A Community Campaign To Stop The Spread Of COVID-19

This social media campaign encourages NWT residents to share the message that the kindest thing we can do to protect our Elders, and keep our loved ones safe, is to stay home and keep at least 2 meters away from people outside our homes.

Community members are encouraged to snap a selfie and submit it (& share it on your social media!) for your messages to be shared along with those of other northerners.

Together, we can send a message loud and clear to everyone in the NWT that NOW is the time to be physically apart, so that we can come together with our Elders in good health again soon.

Protect Our Elders: Radio Ad Writing Competition

This campaign invites you to record your own radio ad that encourages everyone to protect our elders and loved ones by keeping two metres apart, practice good hygiene, and do their part by self-isolating as much as possible.

It can be a song, a story, a touching PSA – the door is wide open and thinking outside the box is encouraged. And don’t think you need a professional recording rig – recording on your phone is good enough.

Music NWT is offering cash prizes for the top entries, as well as an honourable mention for ads that really hit home. The winning ads will be played on NWT radio!

Quick Facts

While anyone can catch it, elders, those who have compromised immune systems, and those who have had diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart or lung disease are most at-risk of catching, and getting very sick from COVID-19.

“Everyone in the territory needs to change their behaviours to limit the spread of this virus – no matter who or where they are. So let’s show our elders how much we care, and engage everyone in the message that we must protect our most vulnerable in this difficult time.”

-Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services

“We are so pleased to continue our partnership with Health and Social Services in working on these incredibly important campaigns. We Are the North! We will persevere but we must all do our part. We need to recognize that staying home and physical distancing is our responsibility for our community and for our loved ones. If it was the other way around and young people were in danger, our Elders would do anything to keep us safe.”

-Lynn Napier, President, Northwest Territories Association of Communities

Good Morning.

Over the past 2 weeks, the situation with COVID-19 has evolved at a pace that none of us could have predicted, and each day brings with it new challenges.

We all know that COVID-19 has very quickly had a significant impact on the Northwest Territories economy, and our government is committed to continuing to put supports in place to help businesses and individuals through this difficult time. 

Just over a week ago, Minister Wawzonek and I announced $13.2 Million dollars in Government of the Northwest Territories supports for our residents.

Today we’re back to announce an additional $8.259 million, bringing the total value to $21.459 million in Government of the Northwest Territories COVID-19 support announced to date.

As Minister Wawzonek outlined, supports included in the announcement today range from Income Assistance increases, to Emergency Housing funds.

Aviation is another area touched on in this wave of supports. This sector, a critical piece of our territorial supply chain, has been especially impacted by COVID-19.

That is why, including the aircraft landing fees already waived, almost $1 million in GNWT financial relief will also be provided to help support critical aviation businesses that our communities and economy rely upon.

Ministers have been meeting regularly, and continue to work with our departments to ensure there is a plan that includes using COVID relief efforts to keep northern and indigenous businesses afloat. Examples such as utilizing northern companies to ensure the supply chain remains intact or to provide Personal Protective equipment, services for decontamination, or safety training.

We are also looking at ways to utilize key infrastructure projects to ensure the construction and consulting sectors are sustained, and that projects critical to our territory, such as long term care facilities, continue to advance.

Departments have been working extremely hard to make sure that project execution remains a focus, while also doing their part to ensure that the precautionary health measures put in place to protect the spread of COVID-19 across our territory are adhered to.

As the Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment, it is part of my job to safeguard our economy, and I want to reassure each resident that I am focused during this time on ensuring minimal impacts to the economy.

I know residents are worried and I continue to hear concerns from people who have lost business revenue, or employment because of COVID-19.

Concerns over mine closures are another big discussion right now.

Our mines and other resource project operators, like all Northwest Territories’ business, are making tough decisions in the interest of the health and wellbeing of their employees, clients, and residents of the NWT. They are also being forced to make difficult decisions about their futures.

All major resource projects are different: in their ownership structures, their operations, and their workforces. These differences directly affect how they go about implementing COVID-19 response plans.

We are supportive of the mines and operations that are prepared to operate safely as long as they can. I can assure the public that the mines are working directly with the Worker’s Safety and Compensation Commission and the Chief Public Health Office to identify a way for them to continue to operate that protects the safety of our residents.

We’re going to see economic impacts of Covid-19 over a range of sectors, but how we react, and the proactive measures we put in place as we face these challenges, will ultimately determine how we are impacted by them.  

The supports announced today will help, but are only part of the equation. 

In the days and weeks that follow, the GNWT will continue to find other ways to support our residents and communities.

We will also continue to work with the Government of Canada and our federal ministerial counterparts to draw their attention to the unique needs of the north and northern businesses. Over the last several weeks I, and my colleagues, have participated in numerous national level calls where we continue to be a strong voice, ensuring that federal relief and recovery programs are relevant and applicable to our unique northern environment.

Together, we will get through this and demonstrate to the world that strong northern resiliency that will help us to come out of this time even stronger.

Thank you.   ",

Good morning

It is a pleasure to be here today, starting the week by talking to you about the second wave of funding and financial program changes that the Government of the Northwest Territories is rolling out to help support individuals, families, businesses and communities.

The last time we were here, when we discussed the roll out of the first wave of financial relief the GNWT put together in response to COVID 19, I said that we would continue to look for opportunities to be creative in the delivery of government services. 

I am pleased to be here again with you today to introduce a second wave of financial relief measures our government has identified to keep or put money in the hands of residents and businesses as we all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID 19.

First, I would like to talk about some changes to the Income Assistance Program.

Minister Simpson and his team have identified a series of immediate changes that will help support some of our most financially vulnerable citizens.

Today, we are introducing a one-time emergency allowance for income assistance recipients that will provide $500 to single recipients, and $1000 to households with two or more people to ensure that they have appropriate cleaning supplies, and are prepared for a 14 day period of self-isolation.

We are also be providing additional benefits to Income Assistance clients by excluding ‘gifts and unearned income’ from the calculation of earned income until June 30, 2020. This change will ensure that income assistance clients are able to keep whatever money they are given or earn over the next several months.

Next, Minister Chinna and her team at the NWTHC have identified $5 million dollars to support the immediate need to provide housing to people who are homeless or have housing instability so that they can self-isolate. $1.4 million of this funding will support the development of 36 housing units at the Aspen apartments and 25 units at the Arnica Inn; while $3.6 million will be directed to renovating 130 units in communities across the NWT. These units will ensure that individuals have somewhere safe to stay right away if they need to self-isolate and will help to reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19 associated with overcrowded and instable housing.

We are also announcing several sector specific initiatives today, including:

Health and Social Services is waiving professional fees for medical professionals in the territory;
The GNWT will waive interest charges on all late tax returns between March 15 and June 30 including fuel tax and payroll tax; and
In support of our restaurant and hospitality industry, the NWTLCC will offer to buy back any unopened alcohol stock, ensuring that businesses have access to the cash they need now.
Together with the initiatives being announced by Minister Nokleby, this second wave of financial relief in response to the COVID 19 pandemic is the next step in our work to support northerners and is valued at approximately $8.259 million. These initiatives are to be implemented immediately. 

This adds to the initial financial responses announced earlier this month for a combined total value of approximately $21.459 million in GNWT financial relief to COVID-19.

As I said the last time, we will continue our work to support the people, businesses and communities of the Northwest Territories.

Our Premier and every Cabinet Minister have regular calls with our Federal, Provincial and Territorial counterparts where we share ideas and initiatives that we are undertaking here in the NWT, as well as thoughts and ideas on how to make the Federal programs as effective as possible for each region’s particular challenges; including, for example, the funding provided to Indigenous governments to support on the land activities. There is no doubt that we will need to continue to work closely with our Federal colleagues as we analyze and ultimately respond to the full financial impacts of COVID in the coming weeks and months.

We will also continue our financial response efforts at home. Several departments are already looking at what areas will require legislative or regulatory change in order to provide further relief for challenges created by the pandemic response. The Department of Finance continues to work with all departments to identify any areas where cost relief can be offered or existing financial supports made more flexible. Our unwavering goal is first and foremost to ensure the physical health of the people of the NWT by limiting the spread of COVID 19 but then also to ensure the mental, social and financial wellbeing of the NWT. We all remain committed to a whole of government response that will achieve these goals.",

Our Premier and every Cabinet Minister have regular calls with our Federal, Provincial and Territorial counterparts where we share ideas and initiatives that we are undertaking here in the NWT, as well as thoughts and ideas on how to make the Federal programs as effective as possible for each region’s particular challenges; including, for example, the funding provided to Indigenous governments to support on the land activities. There is no doubt that we will need to continue to work closely with our Federal colleagues as we analyze and ultimately respond to the full financial impacts of COVID in the coming weeks and months.

We will also continue our financial response efforts at home. Several departments are already looking at what areas will require legislative or regulatory change in order to provide further relief for challenges created by the pandemic response. The Department of Finance continues to work with all departments to identify any areas where cost relief can be offered or existing financial supports made more flexible. Our unwavering goal is first and foremost to ensure the physical health of the people of the NWT by limiting the spread of COVID 19 but then also to ensure the mental, social and financial wellbeing of the NWT. We all remain committed to a whole of government response that will achieve these goals.",

Good morning

It is a pleasure to be here today, starting the week by talking to you about the second wave of funding and financial program changes that the Government of the Northwest Territories is rolling out to help support individuals, families, businesses and communities.

The last time we were here, when we discussed the roll out of the first wave of financial relief the GNWT put together in response to COVID 19, I said that we would continue to look for opportunities to be creative in the delivery of government services. 

I am pleased to be here again with you today to introduce a second wave of financial relief measures our government has identified to keep or put money in the hands of residents and businesses as we all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID 19.

First, I would like to talk about some changes to the Income Assistance Program.

Minister Simpson and his team have identified a series of immediate changes that will help support some of our most financially vulnerable citizens.

Today, we are introducing a one-time emergency allowance for income assistance recipients that will provide $500 to single recipients, and $1000 to households with two or more people to ensure that they have appropriate cleaning supplies, and are prepared for a 14 day period of self-isolation.

We are also be providing additional benefits to Income Assistance clients by excluding ‘gifts and unearned income’ from the calculation of earned income until June 30, 2020. This change will ensure that income assistance clients are able to keep whatever money they are given or earn over the next several months.

Next, Minister Chinna and her team at the NWTHC have identified $5 million dollars to support the immediate need to provide housing to people who are homeless or have housing instability so that they can self-isolate. $1.4 million of this funding will support the development of 36 housing units at the Aspen apartments and 25 units at the Arnica Inn; while $3.6 million will be directed to renovating 130 units in communities across the NWT. These units will ensure that individuals have somewhere safe to stay right away if they need to self-isolate and will help to reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19 associated with overcrowded and instable housing.

We are also announcing several sector specific initiatives today, including:

Health and Social Services is waiving professional fees for medical professionals in the territory;
The GNWT will waive interest charges on all late tax returns between March 15 and June 30 including fuel tax and payroll tax; and
In support of our restaurant and hospitality industry, the NWTLCC will offer to buy back any unopened alcohol stock, ensuring that businesses have access to the cash they need now.
Together with the initiatives being announced by Minister Nokleby, this second wave of financial relief in response to the COVID 19 pandemic is the next step in our work to support northerners and is valued at approximately $8.259 million. These initiatives are to be implemented immediately. 

This adds to the initial financial responses announced earlier this month for a combined total value of approximately $21.459 million in GNWT financial relief to COVID-19.

As I said the last time, we will continue our work to support the people, businesses and communities of the Northwest Territories.

The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) and Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) came to an agreement today, with support from Indigenous leaders, to help Indigenous families who are choosing to be on the land as part of the territory's response to COVID-19. The federal government, through ISC, is providing $2.6 million in federal funding, which will be administered by the Territorial government through their existing partnerships with regional and community-based Indigenous governments. 

Consistent with recommendations of the Northwest Territories' Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Kami Kandola, the planned northern community ""At Home On The Land"" initiative is aligned with broader public health recommendations for increased physical distancing during the Coronavirus pandemic. Many families in the Northwest Territories have already begun to move onto the land to cabins and camps where they can maintain safer physical distances than if they were to remain in their home communities. The funds will support many other families who would not otherwise be able to be on the land because of the financial burden of acquiring necessary provisions, such as wood and fuel, food, First Aid equipment, transportation and other items suitable to their situation and culture. 

Conventional physical distancing measures, like staying at home, that are recommended by Canada's public health officials can have detrimental health effects in some Indigenous communities where housing can be overcrowded. When equipped with the proper supplies and equipment, going on the land in small groups is a positive and healthy form of physical distancing – an important measure in preventing and reducing the spread of the virus.  

The GNWT is asking harvesters to keep in mind the advice of co-management partners and engage in safe and responsible harvesting practices when out on the land:

Be prepared, dress for the conditions and bring a communications device
Always tell someone where you are going and when you will be back
Harvest only what you need
Environment and Natural Resources (ENR) officers will continue to conduct regular patrols and enforcement activities throughout the Northwest Territories (NWT), including the no harvest zone for Bathurst caribou.


Quotes
""Strong, collective action from all levels of government based on recommendations from the Chief Public Health Officer will help all of us mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in our communities. Being on the land is a way of life for many northerners and a good way to slow the spread of this virus. By all of us working together, we will make a difference in how COVID-19 impacts our own families, our neighbours and all residents of the Northwest Territories.""

The Honourable Caroline Cochrane
Premier of Northwest Territories
""The ability to go on the land is about much more than supplies and equipment.  It is built on a rich history of traditional knowledge and skills shared through generations of First Nations, Inuit and Metis families and communities in every corner of the Northwest Territories.  I am pleased that this new funding will help supplement this knowledge with the necessary resources for families to be safe, healthy and comfortable on the land.""      

Michael McLeod
Member of Parliament for the Northwest Territories
""We know that our communities are at higher risk during this unprecedented pandemic. Elders and knowledge keepers have always told us 'a day will come, when we will need to go to the land' and now is that time. Our people are remarkably strong and powerful, and we will do what is required to keep each other safe.  Being on the land is our way of life.  With the closing of the schools, this is also an opportunity for families and their children to learn more about our culture and traditions and what has sustained us as Dene people for thousands of years. I commend both the GNWT and ISC for swift action and prioritizing the health and well-being of the Dene Nation. Mahsi.""

Health officials said the Albertan presumed to now have the virus is a woman in her 50s whom they believe contracted COVID-19 while aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship out of California. She returned home to the Calgary Zone on Feb. 21 and has been self-isolating since Feb. 28. She is expected to make a full recovery, Hinshaw said. “Public health measures are already being put in place to contain the virus and protect Albertans,” a news release said. Hinshaw explained that officials are reaching out to anyone who may have been in contact with the woman. Anyone in close contact who is showing symptoms will be tested. “The World Health Organization mission report from China indicated that asymptomatic transmission, as a major driver of the epidemic, is extremely small and that testing people when they don’t have symptoms, in exceptional circumstances can be considered, but even if someone were to test negative if they don’t have symptoms, we would still ask them to stay home. “So we’re reserving our capacity for testing for those who are feeling ill and asking people who are feeling well from this cruise to stay home until 14 days have passed.” On Wednesday, Alberta Health Services announced it had expanded its testing protocols to also include people who have recently travelled to Hong Kong, Singapore, Iran, South Korea, Japan and Italy. Health officials are encouraging travellers to stay up to date with the latest information regarding the spread of COVID-19, as it’s not known where the virus will spread next. “We ask any travellers returning from these areas, in addition to mainland China, to monitor their symptoms for 14 days after returning,” Hinshaw said. “Should these individuals experience symptoms like fever or cough or have any concerns about their health, I encourage them to stay home and call Health Link at 811 to see if there is a need for testing or follow-up.” As of Friday morning, Alberta Health said 375 people had been tested for COVID-19, all but one coming back with a negative result. The province will hold a media availability at 4 p.m. Friday to update the province’s first presumptive case of the novel coronavirus.",

One patient continues to recover in hospital, while all others are in isolation at home. “We are doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our province. The virus is spreading rapidly and is now a global threat. We are implementing these new measures to slow its spread and limit the risks in the weeks ahead. Protecting the health of Albertans is, and always will be, our top priority.” Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health. “The coming weeks are vital in our fight to protect Alberta from COVID-19. These are serious steps, and ones we do not take lightly.

It does not extend to places of worship, grocery stores, airports or shopping centres. Any event that has more than 50 attendees and expects to have international participants, or involves critical infrastructure staff, seniors, or other high-risk populations should also be cancelled.Events that do not meet these criteria can proceed, but risk mitigation must be in place, such as sanitizer stations and distancing between attendees. At this time, schools and daycares can remain open but steps should be taken to ensure that no more than 250 individuals are in the same room at any given time. Effective March 12, all Albertans who are currently outside the country should self-isolate on their return for 14 days, independent of the country they were visiting. ",

The online service is the first of its kind in Canada and helps people determine whether to call Health Link 811 and get tested for COVID-19. The online questionnaire asks what symptoms, if any, someone is experiencing and takes the user through steps to determine whether testing is needed. Dr. Verna Yiu, CEO of Alberta Health Services, said more than 10,000 people accessed the self-assessment tool in the two-hour period after it launched Friday afternoon. By Saturday around 4 p.m., Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s chief medical officer, said it had received more than 300,000 hits. “At this time, anyone requiring testing will still need to be referred to an assessment centre depending on the result of the online assessment,” said Health Minister Tyler Shandro. “AHS hopes to enhance the tool’s capacity to include appointment and test booking in the very near future.” Article content continued Shandro said calls to Health Link 811 have jumped by 152 per cent. with approximately 6,300 callers per day.

Anyone who has symptoms including a cough, runny nose, fever or sore throat is recommended to self-isolate for 14 days.

Public Health resident Dr. Richelle Schindler has been working on the province's response to COVID-19 since January.  She said in mid-March there was a surge in COVID-19 cases and it became clear that the work they'd been doing on increasing Alberta's contact-tracing capacity needed to be enacted immediately.  Medical students mobilized ""Within the first 24 hours of having those discussions we had already mobilized our first groups of medical students,"" she said. ""Five days later we had trained 150 of them to be ready to go."" Schindler said these U of C medical students are playing a vital role in contacting Albertans who have come in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. ""It means that for every case, we identify everyone they have been in contact with while they were able to spread the illness, and connect with them,"" she said. ""This has allowed us to identify people who were sick and get them rapid access to medical care, keep people with less serious symptoms safely at home, and help people take action to protect their friends and family from becoming ill too."" Schindler said countries that have done this thoroughly and well, including South Korea, Japan, and Singapore, have been able to slow the spread in their communities.  Resources being shared nationwide Dr. Jasmine Pawa with Public Health Physicians of Canada (PHPC) said this is a great example of using available resources in the most appropriate ways support the system. ""I think that there's lots of learning for medical students and being a part of this and in the value of public health and public health responses to this kind of work,"" she said. ""I think it's important for us to always balance making the best use of our capacity with appropriate training and direction and that's something that's really happening with an example like this."" Pawa said PHPC is now sharing the resources developed in Calgary — including training materials and an overview of the process —with members throughout Canada. ""There are many places across the country looking at doing things like this,"" she said. ""They've shared that they appreciated the resources."" Pawa said it's possible that nurses and other health-care workers could also be brought into the fold and trained to do contact tracing. 'It's excellent' Dru Marshall, provost for the University of Calgary, said this is a good chance for students to learn, and be of good use. ""It's a fantastic opportunity for medical or nursing students to be doing that from an epidemiological understanding of disease and how disease can be transmitted rapidly in the population. I think it's excellent,"" she said. ""It's also of course most importantly supporting the health-care system at a time that we need it most."" Marshall said it's just one example of how the U of C is supporting the fight against COVID-19. ""We have a really interesting connection happening between social work, nursing, and medicine to provide a supportive environment for students both on our campus and in the community,"" she said.""We also have some of our great researchers on the front line doing COVID-19 research and looking at policies around COVID, and some wonderful researchers helping the province map out the time course of what's happening in Alberta.""

On Monday, government house leader Jason Nixon introduced measures to put time limits on questions and debate and allow MLAs to sit into the night to hasten approval of the $57-billion 2020-21 budget. ""We do not know how long this legislature will be able to sit for health reasons. We need the budget passed now to take care of these issues,"" Premier Jason Kenney said Monday during question period. With schools, post-secondary institutions and day cares shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic, Nixon said the government will do whatever it takes to pass the budget as quickly as possible to fund operations for the new fiscal year, which starts on April 1. The government also seeks to amend the budget it presented in February by adding $500 million for testing, public health surveillance and patient care during the pandemic. ""We believe that passing the budget this week as soon as possible is critical,"" Nixon said. ""Things like our health services, hospitals our emergency services need to have stability. ""Opposition leader Rachel Notley said Monday the budget is fatally flawed by oil price projections that predated a global price crash and the global spread of coronavirus. She said the government's haste to force through the budget was ""undemocratic."" Opposition house leader Heather Sweet said the government was using the pandemic as an excuse to ram the budget through. Paid leave depends on federal government The premier also said Monday that 14 days of job-protected, paid sick leave may hinge on a yet-unannounced federal government expansion to employment insurance during the pandemic. On Friday, Kenney announced labour code changes that granted workers in isolation up to 14 days of paid leave, which increased from five days. The government said the details about who would pay employees on leave were still being worked out. In the legislature Monday, Kenney said Alberta is waiting on a federal government announcement that should bring an ""unprecedented expansion"" to employment insurance, including help for self-employed people. ""If there are additional measures that need to be taken by the government of Alberta, we are studying options and possibilities, but first, we believe this is a national responsibility,"" Kenney said. Notley said Monday the government's initial announcement of paid leave was misleading. Fast forwarding budget talk On Tuesday, Nixon tabled six motions to speed up proceedings to get approval for the budget. If passed, his motions would pluck detailed discussions of each ministry's budgets out of committee meetings scheduled this week and condense those ""estimates"" discussions into three hours in the house on Tuesday afternoon. He also moved to limit each reading of the budget to an hour, allowing for a total three hours of debate. He motioned to extend the house's ability to sit into the evenings. He also made motions to limit debate on Bill 5, a related piece of legislation the government must pass to implement changes announced in the budget. ""We will not rise until the budget is passed,"" he said. Sweet said the said the $500 million additional funding for health-care costs is not enough. Adjusting for inflation and a growing number of Albertans, it's less money per person than in the 2018-19 budget, she said. She contrasted the UCP government's rush to get its budget approved against what the federal government did last week, which was able to move quickly to free up money to fight the pandemic. ""Instead, what we see is a government pushing a budget through that impacts all areas of the province, not just health care, and it doesn't address the economic impacts for Albertans — like income support, like what's going to happen now that our daycares and schools are closed. In response, Kenney accused the NDP of playing politics with the pandemic. He said no other provincial legislature is dealing with the same level of resistance from opposition parties to prepare for the pandemic. Notley said no other province wants to approve a budget that includes cuts to health-care funding. 'Budget is in tatters The budget was tabled on Feb. 27 but has not yet been passed. Last Friday, Health Minister Tyler Shandro said plans to cut the number of front-line health-care workers in Alberta are on hold because the province will likely need them to cope with the pandemic. Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour, called on the government Monday to scrap the budget and start over. ""The budget tabled two weeks ago by the Kenney government is no longer worth the paper it's written on,"" McGowan said. ""Given the unprecedented challenges currently facing our health care system and our economy, this kind of austerity will only make a bad situation much, much worse. ",

On Thursday, the province announced the Babylon app would be offered through an alternative relationship plan (ARP) between the Alberta government and TELUS. The government said the app is meant to supplement existing services. A spokesperson also stressed the province is hearing calls from doctors to better support virtual care and a plan is in the works with more details to be announced “in the coming days.” The Babylon app is not available to all Alberta physicians. In fact, it’s a relatively small project (with an annual budget of $1.5 million) that only involves a small group of doctors. “I am beyond frustrated at this,” Dr. Heather Shonoski, a physician in Peace River, wrote in a letter shared on Facebook. TWEET THIS “Family physicians have been begging the health minister to allow us to provide virtual care to our patients so that we can keep our vulnerable patients at home and promote social distancing. We want to be able to provide high quality care even if our patients or ourselves are in self-isolation.” READ MORE: Alberta doctors urge government to do more amid coronavirus pandemic After hearing about Babylon, Shonoski said doctors at her clinic called TELUS to ask about using it. They were told they cannot see their own patients through the platform and that it serves as a virtual walk-in, she said. “We want to be able to see our own patients in our own critically under-served rural community where we know our local resources. TWEET THIS “We want to provide continuity of care, which has been proven to save lives and minimize resource use… If we could see our own patients we could do our own follow-up or arrange cross-coverage with proper handover to a colleague in our own community. This would minimize the risk of medical error.” [ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ] Shonoski said health-care workers are preparing for increased demands in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. They’re also trying to find ways to keep patients and health-care workers safe, including providing patient care over the phone or through other video-chat and remote methods. “The billing code for virtual care and phone advice available to physicians in this pandemic is set at the same rate as it was during the H1N1 pandemic – $20 per patient. Providing adequate care can sometimes take up to 40 minutes of direct counselling, reviewing labs, sending prescriptions, etc., per patient. At this rate, physicians providing virtual care will not be able to afford to pay their overhead. “We are faced with yet another difficult choice during this crisis: do we have patients physically come in to the clinic and increase their risk or do we shut down our clinics/go bankrupt/lay off our staff and keep patients safe?” Several other doctors reached out to Global News with similar concerns. Brendan Vaughan, a Calgary doctor working at Southport Family Practice, said he has no problem with patients accessing health care in a way that works best for them but he does have a problem with the government not actively leveling the playing field for family doctors. “Why is the government pushing a corporate ARP project remunerating episodic care by phone, but not investing in crisis telemedicine supports for the MDs people already know and trust?” Vaughan said family physicians are busier than ever while trying to move to remote care to protect against COVID-19. “Everyone is rapidly transitioning to this model of care… It’s the prudent thing to do,” he said. TWEET THIS “We need to be really creative on being on the leading edge of telemedicine in this province… We are dragging our heels with respect to our primary care mobilization.” READ MORE: Saskatchewan doctors providing virtual appointments amid novel coronavirus concerns He said he’s hearing of clinics closing because they cannot afford to keep their doors open. “In this crisis, Alberta doctors are being paid significantly less for telehealth” compared to other provinces, Vaughan said. “We need support and help to provide the best care we can” to an increasingly fearful population, he added. Alberta doctors have been urging the province to support alternative ways all physicians can meet with patients during the pandemic. They’ve also been asking the province to improve compensation for telephone or video-chat appointments with patients — especially in light of COVID-19. READ MORE: Alberta government halts changes to doctors’ pay for complex modifiers A government spokesperson says they are working on a plan to address this and it will be coming soon. “We recognize the pandemic will place unprecedented demands on physicians to support patients while minimizing office visits,” Steve Buick, spokesperson for the health ministry, told Global News on Friday. “We’ll announce more support in the coming days for all physicians to care for patients through phone calls and other ‘virtual visits.'” TWEET THIS The Alberta government recently reactivated a billing code so that all physicians providing advice through phone, email and videoconferencing — including virtual care — can bill for services using the health service code (HSC) 03.01AD, the government said. It compensates them $20 per phone call and there is no limit on phone calls per day. This includes care related to COVID-19 as well as care not related to the virus. The code will remain active as long as the chief medical officer of health determines it should remain active.",

Steps you can take To protect yourself and others: practice physical distancing wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow avoid touching your face with unwashed hands avoid travel outside Canada watch for COVID-19 symptoms: cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose or sore throat Follow mandatory self-isolation requirements: 14 days if you recently returned from travel outside of Canada or are a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, plus an additional 10 days from the onset of symptoms, should they occur, whichever is longer 10 days minimum if you develop any COVID-19 symptoms, or until the symptoms resolve, whichever is longer If you have concerns about your health: take the COVID-19 self-assessment call Health Link 811 for further instructions if directed by the self-assessment tool do not go to an ER or clinic – if you need immediate medical attention, call 911 and inform them you may have COVID-19 Practice physical distancing Physical distancing involves taking steps to limit the number of people you come into close contact with. It can help you reduce the risk of getting sick. This is not the same as self-isolation. You do not need to remain indoors, but you do need to avoid being in close contact with people. We are asking all Albertans to practice physical distancing to help protect themselves and limit the spread of COVID-19. To protect yourself and others: keep at least 6 feet (about the length of a hockey stick) from others when going out for groceries, medical trips and other essential needs limit the number of times you leave your home for errands try to shop at less busy times order online to have groceries or other items delivered if possiblego for a walk in your neighbourhood or park while maintaining distance from others avoid overcrowding in elevators or other enclosed spaces follow Alberta’s mandatory restrictions on mass gatherings wash or sanitize your hands after touching communal surfaces Medical masks Medical masks include N95 masks and surgical or procedure masks. N95 masks protect from exposure to biological aerosols that may contain viruses or bacteria. They are generally only required during specific, high-risk medical procedures. Surgical or procedure masks provide a barrier to splashes, droplets, saliva or spit. They are not designed to fit tightly against the face. Medical masks must be kept for health care workers and others providing direct care to COVID-19 patients and will not beiverted away from these groups. Non-medical masks Wearing a non-medical mask, such as a homemade cloth mask, has not been proven to protect the person wearing it. However, it may be helpful in protecting others around you. Face coverings should only be used in addition to other steps to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. Face coverings are another way to cover your mouth and nose to prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating other people or surfaces. Additionally, wearing a mask may stop you from touching your nose and mouth. If you choose to use a non-medical face mask: you must wash your hands immediately before putting it on and immediately after taking it off (in addition to practicing good hand hygiene while wearing it) it should fit well (non-gaping) you should not share it with others Face masks can become contaminated on the outside, or when touched by your hands. When wearing a mask, take the following precautions to protect yourself: avoid touching your face mask while using it change a cloth mask as soon as it gets damp or soiled put it directly into the washing machine or a bag that can be emptied into the washing machine and then disposed of cloth masks can be laundered with other items using a hot cycle, and then dried thoroughly. non-medical masks that cannot be washed should be discarded and replaced as soon as they get damp, soiled or crumpled dispose of masks properly in a lined garbage bin don't leave discarded masks in shopping carts, on the ground, etc. The most important steps you can take to prevent the spread of infection are: consistent adherence to good hygiene such as proper hand washing following all public health orders staying home whenever possible and practicing physical distancing when you need to go out This is why people who have a cough or respiratory symptoms must wear masks and wash their hands when visiting an emergency department or clinic. Enforcement On March 25, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health issued orders under the Public Health Act to legally require returning international travellers, close contact of confirmed cases, and people exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms to self-isolate. Law enforcement agencies have been granted full authority to enforce public health orders and issue fines: Through amendments to the Public Health Act, community peace officers and police will be able to issue tickets to enforce COVID-19 public health orders. Fines administered through tickets for violating an order have increased from up to $100 per day to a prescribed fine of $1,000 per occurrence. Courts will also have increased powers to administer fines of up to $100,000 for a first offence and up to $500,000 for a subsequent offence for more serious violations. These new fines will be in force over the coming days. If you know someone who is not self-isolating when they are legally required to: take proper precautions and distance yourself from the person to limit your risk of exposure if they have symptoms remind the person that not following public health orders is against the law and puts people at risk",

Under the new setup, the general population and people who returned to Alberta in March after travelling abroad are encouraged to stay at home for a period of 14 days, physically distancing themselves from others, instead of seeking testing. Prioritized testing is in place for the following groups if symptoms appear.  People who are hospitalized with respiratory illness. Residents of continuing care and other similar facilities. People who returned from travelling abroad between March 8 and March 12 (before the self-isolation protocols were in place. Healthcare workers with respiratory symptoms ""Changing our testing protocols will allow us to focus Alberta’s testing capacity on those most at risk,"" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, in a statement released Monday morning. ""This is consistent with the approach happening across Canada. It will enable us to strategically use our testing resources. Our new approach reflects the fact that the most important thing anyone can do if they have mild symptoms isn’t to get tested – it’s to stay home and self-isolate.""As of Sunday, there were 259 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Alberta — 164 in the Calgary Zone — and 16 of the cases were contracted through community transmission. According to the province, Alberta Health Services is working to ensure travellers receive proper advice on self-isolation and monitoring symptoms upon their return to Alberta. The testing policy change goes into effect immediately but tests will be conducted on anyone who has been previously told by Health Link that they will be tested. Correction: The original version of this story indicated the self-isolation period for people returning to Alberta after international travel was 10 days. The self-isolation period remains 14 days for travellers",

The new protections mean: Effective immediately, tenants cannot be evicted for non-payment of rent and/or utilities before May 1. Effective immediately, rents will not increase while Alberta’s state of public health emergency remains in effect. Effective April 1, late fees cannot be applied to late rent payments for the next three months. Effective April 1, landlords and tenants need to work together to develop payment plans while the state of public health emergency is in effect. “We want to be clear: As of today, no one will be facing immediate eviction from their home for non-payment of rent or utilities owed to the landlord. Additionally, tenants will not face increasing financial pressure from rent increases or fees for late rent payments.

Late fees Until June 30, landlords cannot further penalize tenants who are late on rent by charging late fees, even if the signed rental agreement states that a late fee can be applied. Landlords will also not be able to retroactively collect late fees for this period. “As housing providers, we fully support our provincial leaders, so together, we can support all residential renters in Alberta affected by COVID-19 and continue to provide the essential service of a safe, healthy and peaceful place to call home through flexibility and mutual resolve. Together, we will all get through this.” Sam Kolias, chief executive officer, Boardwalk “The government’s plan to offer rental protections to people unable to pay their rent due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to me, seems like an excellent step forward in battling this public health crisis.

This is a necessary addition to other recently announced measures. We will continue to support Albertans and Alberta businesses during this tumultuous time, and will continue to evaluate and expand our efforts where possible.” Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance Hotels and other lodging providers are still expected to file returns, as required by legislation, and must continue to collect the tourism levy from guests staying at their properties during this period. Payments deferred until Aug. 31 will not be subject to penalties or interest. “This is a welcome move by the government during the unprecedented pressures the hotel and lodging industry is facing due to COVID-19. Deferring the tourism levy will create critical cash flow for operators at a time when they need it most.” Dave Kaiser, president and CEO, Alberta Hotel and Lodging Association This measure is in addition to other recently announced supports for Alberta businesses, which are facing unprecedented pressures as a result of the severe economic challenges spurred by the COVID-19 outbreak and current oil price shock. Additional measures to assist Alberta employers The collection of corporate income tax balances and instalment payments is deferred until Aug. 31. This gives Alberta businesses access to about $1.5 billion in funds to help them cope with the COVID-19 crisis. Education property tax amounts are frozen at 2019 levels, saving Alberta households and businesses about $87 million in 2020-21. Education property tax payments by businesses are deferred for six months, leaving $458 million with job creators to help them pay employees and continue operations. Private-sector employers can defer paying Workers’ Compensation Board premiums until 2021, with a rebate eligible for those who have already paid their 2020 WCB premiums. Government will pay 50 per cent of 2020 WCB premiums for small and medium businesses. Utility payments for residential, farm and small commercial customers can be deferred for the next 90 days to ensure no one is cut off from electricity and natural gas services during this time of crisis.",

“We are announcing 35 new cases, for a total of 1,445 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 642 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 558 are in the Fraser Health region, 84 are in the Island Health region, 135 are in the Interior Health region and 26 are in the Northern Health region.

“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths all in long-term care facilities, for a total of 58 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.

“There have been no new long-term care outbreaks in the last day. Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health teams continue to provide support to the 20 remaining affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 246 cases of COVID-19.

“Fraser Health teams continue to provide support for the outbreak in Mission Institution, a federal correctional centre, which has a total of 26 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Five people affiliated with the facility have been hospitalized.

“Infection control and prevention measures are in place. Fraser Health continues to work with federal officials to limit the further transmission of this virus.

“To date, 905 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 134 individuals are hospitalized and 63 of those in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“In the middle of a holiday weekend, we are encouraged that people are staying home and avoiding putting unnecessary strain on our smaller, rural and remote communities. This is how we can continue to support and protect our loved ones, our Elders and our health-care workers.

“We are paying special attention to international travellers returning to British Columbia. They are required to complete a self-isolation plan and self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. This process is now in place at B.C.’s land and air borders to protect us all.

“This is the time for all of us to stay strong in our commitment to flatten the curve – to do all that we can to support one another so we can all succeed in this goal.”",

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 128 individuals are hospitalized and 65 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“This holiday weekend is an important time for many British Columbians of diverse faiths. As we reflect on the past few weeks and the challenges we have all faced together, we are reminded of the importance of connecting and protecting our loved ones, our Elders, our health-care workers and our communities.

“This is not the time to travel, unless absolutely necessary. Stay at home and be creative with how you connect and celebrate with family and friends. Find the virtue in virtual and telephone connections. Find togetherness without gathering.

“A reminder that while all BC Parks are closed, one can still enjoy some fresh air by going for walks or bike rides with your family in your neighbourhood and remembering to keep a safe distance.

“British Columbians coming home from travel are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival and complete a self-isolation plan. It is crucial for all of us to stay strong in our commitment to flatten the curve. Consider the support that we can give one another, to our loved ones and in our communities, so we can all succeed in this goal.

“B.C. continues to be prepared for the event of a surge in COVID-19 cases. The 271-bed Vancouver Convention Health Centre and 80 new beds at Royal Columbian Hospital and 84 beds at Weatherby Pavilion long-term care home are set up as alternate care sites and ready to be operationalized as needed. This is a critical step to ensure that B.C. is prepared for the worst as we work for the best outcome.

693,2020-04-09,,Canada,British Columbia,,Opening of temporary rental supplement for renters who experience loss in income,Emergency economic funding,General,Not Applicable,S8 Fiscal measures,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0050-000669,BC Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing,,Government Website,Applications open for temporary rental supplement,"Renters who are experiencing a loss of income during the COVID-19 pandemic can now apply for the Province’s new temporary rental supplement.

“This crisis is putting pressure on people across B.C. We’re helping British Columbians get through this by halting evictions so renters will not lose their home. We’re helping them pay rent with the new temporary rental supplement – providing direct relief on the biggest month-to-month expense for most households,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Together with the other provincial and federal programs, the rental supplement will give people the financial support they need right now.”

The program will provide $300 per month for eligible households with no dependents and $500 per month for eligible households with dependents. Eligible roommates will each be able to apply for the supplement.

The rental supplement is available on a per-household basis to those who meet all of the following criteria:

    receiving or eligible for Employment Insurance, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or experiencing a 25% reduction in monthly employment income as a result of COVID-19;
    2019 household income of less than $74,150 for households with no dependents and $113,040 for households with dependents;
    paying more than 30% of current/reduced gross monthly income towards rent; and
    not receiving any other rent subsidy from any level of government, including subsidized housing or rent supplements, such as Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) or the Rental Assistance Program (RAP).

The supplement will be available for April, May and June 2020. Renters who are eligible for the program and have already paid their April rent are still able to receive the rental supplement for this month.

The supplement will be paid directly to landlords on behalf of renters to reduce tenants’ rent owing and ensure landlords are getting some rental income right now. Once an application is completed and processed, funds will be direct deposited within approximately seven days. BC Housing has redeployed employees and brought on additional staff to make sure applications are processed as quickly as possible.

The rental supplement is in addition to funding available from the federal government and the $1,000 B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers. It’s part of the Province’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people and businesses, and to support the services people count on.

The Province has also halted evictions and frozen rent increases for existing tenants during this emergency, is allowing landlords to restrict the use of common areas to protect against the transmission of COVID-19, and has given renters the right to control who enters their units, except in emergency circumstances.",

“We are announcing 34 new cases, for a total of 1,370 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 626 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 508 are in the Fraser Health region, 82 are in the Island Health region, 130 are in the Interior Health region and 24 are in the Northern Health region.

“We are saddened to report two new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and one in Fraser Health region, for a total of 50 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.

“There have been no new long-term care outbreaks in the last day, and the outbreak at Villa Cathay facility has been declared over. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health teams continue to provide support to the 20 remaining affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 235 cases of COVID-19.

“To date, 858 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 132 individuals are currently hospitalized, 68 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“To flatten the curve, we must ensure our health system is robust and fully able to address the unparalleled challenges of COVID-19. We must also take care of our front-line workers so they can care for us, protect and support our most vulnerable, and do all we can to keep our firewall strong.

“This is a challenging time for all of us – physically, emotionally and mentally – especially when our meaningful connections are virtual connections. There are many resources available and, as the Province announced today, more are on the way. If you are struggling and need help, please reach out.

“This holiday weekend is not the time for travel, unless absolutely necessary. Rather, let’s make it an ‘unwind and be kind’ weekend at home. There are lots of things we can do to relax, have fun and connect with family, friends and our local community at a safe distance.

“Residents at long-term care and assisted-living homes are very vulnerable to COVID-19. One of the most important things we can do to protect them, and those caring for them, is to make it possible for workers to provide services at a single facility, reducing the risk of virus transmission between facilities.

“Using orders under the Public Health and Emergency Programs acts, we have implemented a process to support workers to work at a single facility. This includes development of a new labour agreement that ensures all workers – at health authority, non-profit and private facilities – receive an equitable wage and work-hours scheduling stability so they can work at a single site without disrupting services for residents.

“Long-term care and assisted living care-giving and support staff are responding courageously to monumental challenges during this unprecedented time, and deserve our respect and support.”",

“If you are feeling anxious, stressed, depressed or disconnected because of COVID-19, I want you to know that you are not alone,” said Premier John Horgan. “Our government is working to give you more options for mental health support as we all stay home to prevent the spread of this virus.”

Enhanced virtual services will help all British Columbians with mental health needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on adults, youth and front-line health care workers. The funding will also increase access for Indigenous communities and those living in rural and remote parts of the province. It will provide more options for people living with mental health challenges who are currently unable to access in-person supports.

“I have heard from people right across B.C. about how this pandemic is taking a toll on their mental health,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Whether longstanding challenges are flaring up or you’re struggling with your mental health for the first time – we’re here for you. We’re working quickly to expand virtual mental health services to ensure that when you reach out for support, someone will be there to help.”

The Province is working in partnership with Foundry Youth Centres, the Canadian Mental Health Association – BC Division (CMHA-BC), the BC Psychological Association and other community partners to deliver new and expanded mental health services. These include:

providing more access to online programs for mental health by expanding the BounceBack program. BounceBack provides online coaching and the Living Life to the Full program, which helps people deal with life challenges and learn self-management skills (CMHA-BC);
expanding access to no- and low-cost community counselling programs, including those that serve immigrant and refugee populations, and enabling them to be delivered virtually;
increasing access to online peer support and system navigation (CMHA-BC);
providing virtual supports for youth aged 12 to 24 by making Foundry services available around the province through voice, video and chat (FoundryBC);
providing more online tools and resources to help people assess and manage their own mental health;
supporting front-line health-care workers through a new online hub and providing virtual peer support (CMHA-BC); and
a new online psychological support service for health-care workers (BC Psychological Association).
Existing services are being scaled up rapidly to meet increased need while new services are being implemented. Several services are available and online, while others will come online April 20, 2020. See the backgrounder below for details.

The emphasis on virtual support and care will be offered in multiple languages, as well as connect people living in rural and remote communities and Indigenous peoples throughout the province. The Province will continue to collaborate with Indigenous partners to ensure these services are culturally safe and responsive to the needs of Indigenous peoples in rural and urban areas.

This funding is in addition to a co-ordinated effort across government to bolster virtual mental health services for children, youth and students related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Quotes:

Jonny Morris, CEO, CMHA-BC –

“The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound impacts on the mental health of British Columbians, with increased reports of stress, worry, depression, anxiety and loss. This investment will help the CMHA and our partners respond to the growing mental health impacts of COVID-19 through increased access to warm, compassionate and skilled virtual care. It is critical that expanded access to mental health and substance use care is part of the ongoing response to COVID-19. Now, more than ever, we need these mental health supports to reach people, even while we remain physically apart.”

Dr. Steve Mathias, executive director, Foundry –

“At this unprecedented time, it is even more important for youth and families across B.C. to know where to find the supports and services they need. With the support of the provincial government and our nine Foundry centres, Foundry is moving our services online, starting with drop-in counselling, and then peer support services and physical health care. We’re pleased to be able to provide these services virtually so that young people and families in all corners of the province can get the help they need, when they need it.”

Lesley D Lutes, Phd, R. Psych., professor, director of clinical training, Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia (UBC) Okanagan; and director of public advocacy, British Columbia Psychological Association –

“On behalf of my colleagues at UBC Okanagan and the BC Psychological Association, we will work tirelessly on this initiative, not only to support direct patient care, but to provide training and support to our mental health colleagues and the next generation of psychologists. We are eager to assist in evaluating new and extended services to ensure that they are both evidence based and delivered to the highest possible level of care. We look forward to developing a meaningful partnership with the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, and I want to thank Minister Darcy for her support thus far. Whether it’s mental or physical health, I’m pleased that we are all coming together to put the health and well-being of British Columbians first.”",

“Flattening the curve is about following the orders and restrictions in place, and equally important, supporting others to make it easy for them to do the same.

“Right now, it is critical to stay strong in our commitment to protect our province. We cannot allow for gaps that could set back all the positive efforts we have made so far.

“The new requirement for returning travellers to have an approved self-isolation plan is one more tool to help make that happen.

“We thank the many volunteer organizations and public servants who have stepped up to enable this important action. Teams will be connecting with travellers at borders and while self-isolating to ensure they have the necessary support that may be required.

“All of us need to avoid unnecessary travel, particularly to smaller communities where there are fewer health resources. While many of us have family and friends in Alberta, we must not travel to visit them this long weekend. We need to make the choice to protect our friends and family by staying home and finding virtual ways to connect. Consider the significant impact one step in the wrong direction could have on all of us.

“Let’s bend the curve, not the rules and stay safe.”

The measures, which include a new legal requirement to provide a self-isolation plan, support the provincial health officer’s travel orders and reinforce the federal emergency order under the Quarantine Act requiring people entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days.

“As we welcome British Columbians back home, we must stay vigilant and do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Premier John Horgan. “As we follow the advice and guidance of our provincial health officer, it’s also important to take care of one another. By supporting people through a self-isolation plan after international travel, we will keep people safe and help flatten the curve.”

Effective immediately, international travellers (including from the United States) coming to the province are required to provide a self-isolation plan before or upon arrival to B.C., regardless of their point of entry to Canada.

This document, which can be submitted online or completed in person on arrival, must show that returning travellers have supports in place to safely self-isolate for 14 days.

Beginning Friday, April 10, 2020, provincial officials will be on hand at the Vancouver International Airport and major land border crossings to make sure self-isolation plans are complete and to assist those who need it.

Upon border arrival, self-isolation plans will be reviewed by officials, and travellers will be supported as follows:

If a self-isolation plan is submitted and approved, travellers will receive a confirmation. This confirmation can be shown on arrival. Travellers with approved plans will proceed to their home residence (or another identified accommodation) to self-isolate.
If an airline traveller arrives and an adequate self-isolation plan is proposed but needs additional support to execute safely (e.g., enlist volunteers to deliver groceries or fill prescriptions once at home), travellers may be taken or directed to an accommodation site provided in collaboration with the provincial and federal governments to begin self-isolation, while outstanding details of their plan are put in place. With an approved self-isolation plan, they may return home. Without an approved plan, they will remain at an accommodation site for 14 days.
If a traveller arrives at a major land border crossing and needs additional supports to execute a self-isolation plan, they will be sent directly home to start self-isolating and will be followed up with by officials for additional support.
If a traveller does not have a self-isolation plan or is unable to safely carry one out as determined by officials, they may be transported or sent to an accommodation provided by government where they can safely complete their 14-day self-isolation.
Emergency Management BC, through a network of community supports and volunteer organizations, will help travellers with necessary food deliveries, prescription drugs and other supplies so people can safely self-isolate for 14 days.

The Province, through Service BC, will follow up with travellers in self-isolation with telephone calls and text messages to make sure people have the support they need to complete their mandatory self-isolation. If required, the Province will work with travellers to modify self-isolation plans to ensure public safety.

The federal government will continue to use its authority under the Quarantine Act to ensure compliance with the emergency order requiring individuals entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days, enforceable by the RCMP. Maximum penalties for breaking the federal emergency order include fines of up to $750,000 and/or imprisonment for six months, or up to $1 million and/or imprisonment up to three years for a person who causes a risk of imminent death or serious bodily harm.

Quick Facts:

Self-isolation plans can be submitted at: www.gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers
Self-isolation plans can also be submitted via the BC COVID-19 Support App and Self-Assessment Tool under “travellers.”
24/7 land crossing borders are the Douglas (Peace Arch), Pacific, Osoyoos and Boundary Bay.
Essential service workers who must travel across the border for work must still create a self-isolation plan and self-monitor. However, they are only expected to implement their plan if they develop symptoms. These essential workers include health-care workers, critical infrastructure, trade and transportation workers, airline crews and people making medical deliveries.

“While people across the province are staying home to stem the spread of COVID-19 and protect us all, for some, home is not a safe place. We know that social isolation is making life harder for women and children who live in unstable or violent situations.

“If you reach out for help, we will make sure there is a safe space during this emergency – no matter where you live in B.C.

“BC Housing is already working with our partner organizations to support women and children who would otherwise be trapped at home in dangerous situations.

“I want to thank all of our partners and the front-line workers who are there for women and children now, and every day. We could not do this work without you. I also want to thank Minister Selina Robinson, BC Housing and Premier Horgan for their leadership on providing supports for people who need them most during this time of crisis.

“If you or someone you know is experiencing violence or abuse, please contact VictimLinkBC at 1 800 563-0808 or by email at: VictimLinkBC@bc211.ca

“They can connect you to these supports and are available to help 24/7 with service in multiple languages.

“We have been hearing from families of children with special needs that they are facing a lot of uncertainty right now,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We want to help, so we’re offering these families emergency funding and allowing more flexibility in our supports. Our government is committed to helping make life a little easier during this unprecedented and very challenging time.”

The Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) is establishing an Emergency Relief Support Fund for children and youth with special needs and their families. The fund will provide a direct payment of $225 per month to eligible families over the next three months (to June 30, 2020).

Using a needs-based approach, the emergency funding will support 50% more of the eligible families that are currently awaiting services. This payment can be used to purchase supports that help alleviate stress. These could include:

meal preparation and grocery shopping assistance;
homemaking services
caregiver relief support (e.g., funded support to allow a family member to provide temporary care for a child or youth);
counselling services, online or by phone; and
and other services that support family functioning.
Policy guidelines for many Children and Youth with Special Needs (CYSN) services will be more flexible to ensure families continue to benefit from other funding and supports, even as access to many in-person school and community-based services remain limited:

Families with children in care on a special needs agreement or a voluntary care agreement will not have to make monthly maintenance payments for the duration of the pandemic period. This will provide temporary relief to parents who may be struggling with income or housing insecurity related to the pandemic.
Supported Child Development and Aboriginal Supported Child Development programs will be able to extend extra staffing during school hours to help with the reduced availability of school-based services. Children of parents who are essential service providers and need extra staffing supports for their child will continue to receive those throughout the pandemic period.
Eligibility and access to At Home Program medical benefits will be relaxed, and any families receiving benefits will continue to do so without the need for a reassessment during the pandemic period.
Parameters on services purchased with Autism Funding will be expanded, allowing families to use up to 35% of funding to purchase equipment and items that assist in home learning and virtual instructional approaches.
Families may direct their child’s Autism Funding to access family counselling and therapy services with a qualified provider for all age categories accessing the Autism Funding program.
MCFD recognizes that each child and family faces unique circumstances and has unique needs. Families are encouraged to reach out to their CYSN worker to see how they can benefit from emergency help.

The Emergency Relief Support Fund is sustained by a $900,000 investment. This is part of government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.

Quick Facts:

About 30,000 children and youth with special needs access CYSN services.
MCFD provides autism funding to families of more than 16,000 children and youth diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
There are approximately 275 families with children on a Special Needs Agreement or Voluntary Care Agreement.
Families of more than 6,300 children with special needs access Supported Child Development or Aboriginal Supported Child Development programs.

These restrictions will help prevent environmental damage and ensure orders and guidance from the provincial health officer related to the COVID-19 pandemic are followed.

The restrictions will take effect at 1 p.m. (Mountain time) on Wednesday, April 8, 2020, and will remain in place until further notice.

Although overnight camping will be prohibited in this area, people may still use designated roads and trails on a day-use basis as long as they adhere to physical distancing guidelines and other restrictions that may be in place.

The Koocanusa Recreation Strategy (see link below) contains a map of the Koocanusa Recreation Strategy area.

These restrictions are implemented by the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development under Section 58 of the Forest and Range Practices Act, in partnership with the Conservation Officer Service, the RCMP, the Ktunaxa Nation and the Tobacco Plains Indian Band, as well as other local government stakeholders in the region.

There have been growing concerns in recent years about unauthorized mudbogging (i.e., operating or racing off-road vehicles in wet earth or mud) on Crown land around the Koocanusa reservoir — particularly in the Dorr Road and Umbrella Beach areas — and its associated impacts on the land and the environment.

Specific stewardship concerns due to mudbogging and related activities include:

water and soil contamination;
damage to forest and rangeland habitat;
lack of sanitation and garbage facilities;
public safety;
impacts on archeological and cultural resources;
damage to recreational infrastructure; and
displacement of wildlife.
The Section 58 restrictions are consistent with orders and guidance issued by the provincial health officer under the provincial state of emergency, regarding physical distancing and a prohibition on public gatherings of more than 50 people. In the midst of a global pandemic that has affected hundreds of people throughout this province and neighbouring jurisdictions, British Columbians and visitors from other provinces are urged to follow the advice of public health officials.

The restrictions will be enforced by the Province’s natural resource officers, conservation officers and the RCMP, who will conduct regular patrols and educate the public at access points into the area. People who do not comply with the restrictions may be issued a violation ticket for $115 and told to leave the area.

The restrictions for the Koocanusa Recreation Strategy area align with the decision by Recreation Sites and Trails BC to close its campgrounds and amenities to gatherings and overnight camping in response to COVID-19.

The B.C. government has been working collaboratively with the Ktunaxa Nation, stakeholders and local governments for several years on a Koocanusa Recreation Strategy.
The development of this strategy includes the management of camping and trail use in the area.
Mudbogging is not considered a legitimate activity and is neither supported nor included in the Koocanusa Recreation Strategy.

701,2020-04-08,,Canada,British Columbia,,Closure of all BC provincial parks,Public park closure,General,Refusal of Entry,S2 Workplace closing,2.0,,,1.0,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020ENV0019-000645,Environment and Climate Change Strategy,,Government Website,All BC Parks closing,"BC Parks is immediately closing all provincial parks in response to the widespread call for increased action to address COVID-19.

The closure responds to both the federal and provincial directives that people should stay close to home to reduce COVID-19 transmission risk. This temporary measure means people should not be going to provincial parks until further notice.

“Because physical distancing works, it is critical that we take every action needed to restrict the spread of COVID-19. This applies to British Columbians and out-of-province visitors who were planning to visit or stay at our provincial parks. The message is clear: stay home, avoid travel, do not put yourself or others at risk,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy.

“I understand and share the love people in British Columbia have for the outdoors and the connection between health and proximity to nature. We tried to provide safe space for people to get some exercise and fresh air in our beautiful parks. But it has proven too challenging to maintain safe distance between visitors. This action is difficult but necessary. We look forward to the day we can welcome people back to our wonderful parks.”

The decision to close the park system is informed by continued feedback from RCMP, local government, First Nations, local search-and-rescue organizations and the general public. While many people are observing the physical distancing requirements set by the provincial health officer (PHO), some continue to ignore the order, making enforcement in a wilderness setting challenging.

The timing of this decision is important given the upcoming long weekend and the beginning of the busy season for outdoor recreation and camping. BC Parks is also extending the ban on all camping in provincial parks until May 31, 2020, in alignment with neighbouring jurisdictions and the temporary closure of Canada’s national parks. Refunds for bookings up to May 31 will be sent automatically.

As previously announced, the Recreation Sites and Trails BC (RSTBC) branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development has also closed its campgrounds and amenities in response to the COVID-19 situation.

BC Parks has taken a scaled and phased in approach to limiting park access following PHO requirements and the latest COVID-19 transmission data. BC Parks recognizes the value of nature in contributing to public health and wellness and will expand access to the park system as soon as the PHO indicates it can be done without increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

“We are announcing 25 new cases, for a total of 1,291 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 603 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 458 are in the Fraser Health region, 79 are in the Island Health region, 128 are in the Interior Health region and 23 are in the Northern Health region.

“We are saddened to report a further four COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions for a total of 43 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.

“There have been no new long-term care facility outbreaks in the last day. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health teams continue to provide support to the affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 213 cases of COVID-19.

“To date, 805 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 138 individuals are hospitalized, and 66 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“Starting tomorrow and over the coming days, British Columbians of many faiths, along with millions around the world, will be celebrating major religious holidays in ways that many have never experienced before.

“B.C.’s faith leaders have taken the challenge of maintaining physical distance to heart and are using these holidays as an opportunity to reinforce our commitment to showing kindness and care for our communities.

“We call on faith leaders, followers and congregations to pay special attention to our Elders and seniors to ensure we protect them by connecting safely from a distance.

“We know many people must manage chronic diseases and other health issues. We encourage people to continue to connect with their primary care provider or family physician for ongoing care. Phone and virtual resources are available for everyone.

“This long weekend, we need to stay home, to stay in our communities and to stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside. Avoiding unnecessary travel, particularly to smaller communities, where they may be unable to support you if you get sick and where they have fewer resources, is an important way we can protect ourselves and our loved ones.

“Let’s continue to stand united, to stay strong and do all we can to flatten the curve.”

Henry said B.C.'s Ministry of Health has allocated $2 million to the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research to fund work related to COVID-19. The foundation is the province's health research funding agency. It provides grants to researchers whose work helps improve the health of British Columbians.

Henry highlighted four specific areas of COVID-19 research the province has funded so far, and added that research will continue to be a key component of the provincial response to the virus over the coming months and years.

""This is really an important part of our toolkit to help us get through this first wave of COVID-19 and to help ensure that we know what to do and how we can do it as this pandemic progresses,"" she said.

The four projects Henry highlighted are:

 tracking the transmission of the virus in B.C.
 understanding the underlying susceptibility of the province to the virus,
 developing a vaccine,
 and tracking the effects of what the World Health Organization calls the ""infodemic"" of misinformation about the virus online.
Tracking transmission of COVID-19

The first aspect of research B.C. has funded deals with tracking the transmission of the virus in the province, Henry said.

""That is contributing to the modelling that we have presented as well as the more dynamic modelling, a more detailed model that we'll be talking about in the coming weeks,"" she said.

As of Saturday, there had been 1,203 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the province, though that number includes only those who have tested positive. B.C. has focused its testing on those who are at higher risk, particularly health-care workers, seniors and those with underlying health conditions.

Understanding B.C.'s susceptibility

A project to understand the ""baseline susceptibility of people in British Columbia to COVID-19"" will allow the province to be systematic in its approach to future testing, Henry said.

She described this project as putting ""the building blocks in place"" to support tests that will show who has had the virus already and is immune to it, which will help with future modelling.

Developing a vaccine

Henry said there are currently at least 25 ongoing efforts around the world to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. British Columbia is using part of its research funding to aid those efforts.

Understanding the 'infodemic'

This project is aimed at studying ""the myriad of information that is out there on social media, on other platforms, and how that affects people's behaviours through this pandemic,"" Henry said.

According to the World Health Organization, ""infodemics are an excessive amount of information about a problem, which makes it difficult to identify a solution."" They allow misinformation, disinformation and rumours to spread and can hamper public health responses by creating confusion and distrust among the public.

More research coming

In addition to those four existing projects, B.C. will be funding future research on the coronavirus through the Michael Smith Foundation, which will open its first call for project submissions on April 6.

In a news release, the ministry said the call will be the first of several, and that the foundation will be looking for ""projects that could provide high-quality scientific research to help B.C. get through the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic safely and effectively, and that could help prevent a significant return in the future.""

At her briefing Saturday, Henry described some of the research the province is looking to fund, including a ""rapid evaluation of the public health countermeasures.""

""How well are we doing with things that we have put in place, like travel restrictions, like the cancelling of in-classroom teaching in schools, like the distancing measures that we have been putting in place across society?"" Henry said.

The province is also interested in projects looking at B.C.-specific epidemiology that looks at specific subpopulations within the province.

""All of these are really ways to bring the brightest minds and researchers that we have across B.C. together and to link them with our colleagues around the world and across the country,"" Henry said. ",

“We are announcing 29 new cases, for a total of 1,203 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 554 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 424 are in the Fraser Health region, 76 are in the Island Health region, 128 are in the Interior Health region and 21 are in the Northern Health region.

“There have been 38 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. In the last 24 hours, we are saddened to report a further two deaths in the Vancouver Coastal health region and one in the Fraser Health region. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.

“There are now outbreaks in 23 long-term care and assisted-living facilities in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions, with a combined 197 cases of COVID-19. Residents in these facilities are the most vulnerable citizens, and efforts to protect them continue to be a major focus of our health teams.

“To date, 704 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 149 individuals are currently hospitalized, 68 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“Everyone in British Columbia is doing what it takes to protect our families, our elders, our health-care workers and our communities.

“We must continue to hold the line; to keep our firewall strong and flatten the curve.

“A key part of our response is high quality scientific research to help B.C. get through the first wave of COVID-19 safely and find ways to prevent it from returning here and around the world.

“A new COVID-19 Strategic Research Advisory Committee, led by Dr. David Patrick and supported by former provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall and other notable public health experts, is facilitating research efforts across the province.

“The committee’s work includes advising the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, which has received $2 million to fund research in several important public health areas.

“Their research will focus on B.C.-specific epidemiology and public health countermeasures to address some of the challenges of long-term care homes, inner city populations, rural communities, Indigenous people, and health-care workers. This is in addition to a variety of research that is already underway across B.C., as we do all we can to understand this virus, to stop transmission and protect our province.”",

“This is the moment that will make the difference. We must hold the line and be unwavering in our commitment to keep our firewall strong, to slow the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the curve.

“For those whose loved ones are now returning home, we encourage you to support them as they self-isolate. We have seen countless examples of how you can maintain physical distance and also provide social connection.

“Those who have been here from the outset, please keep going. Those who are now returning, join us, so we can all stand proud knowing we have all done the right thing.”

EquipCare BC is a new program that will provide $10 million to enhance infection prevention and control, and improve quality and safety in long-term care and assisted living homes throughout the province.

“Seniors and residents of long-term care and assisted living homes are the most vulnerable due to complications associated with COVID-19,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Our goal is to ensure that both residents and health-care workers are protected to the maximum extent possible.”

More than 240 long-term care homes and more than 200 assisted living homes in B.C. will be eligible for funding to support increased infection prevention and control measures in their homes. Funds may be used to buy items, including outbreak carts and mobile hand-hygiene sinks, touchless towel and soap dispensers, and safe handling equipment for waste and laundry.

“We are committed to protecting our seniors and elders during this critical time of COVID-19,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors. “This program will further equip long-term care and assisted living residences with the tools to enhance safety measures for seniors and caregivers in these residences.” 

BCCPA will administer the program and accept applications from facilities beginning on Saturday, April 4, 2020. The program will initially focus on supporting infection prevention and control through to the end of summer to address immediate needs related to COVID-19. Following this, the focus of the program will shift to funding for safety and quality improvements in publicly funded facilities.

“With this new funding, we can move swiftly to get these important protections against the spread of COVID-19 in our care homes and assisted living residences,” said Daniel Fontaine, CEO, BCCPA. “Operators can expect to receive funding within weeks of a completed application. Not only will EquipCare BC be an efficiently run program, but it will continue to improve workplace safety and quality of life for seniors in care.”

Oversight for EquipCare BC will be provided by a group of industry stakeholders and government, including representatives from BCCPA, SafeCare BC, Denominational Health Association and the Ministry of Health. An additional appointment to the oversight committee will include a provincial representative with expertise in infection prevention control.

Further information about EquipCare BC will be posted here: www.bccare.ca

The launch of EquipCare BC supports additional actions in place to protect seniors from the risks of COVID-19. In addition, the Province is providing the United Way of the Lower Mainland with $50 million to increase seniors’ supports at community service agencies throughout British Columbia.

Quick Facts:

In 2019, 20% of B.C.’s population was 65 or over; in 15 years, this is expected to rise to 25%.
EquipCare BC expands the mandate and scope of the Seniors Safety Quality Improvement Program (SSQIP).
SSQIP funded $10 million of safety and quality improvements to 99% of eligible long-term care operators in B.C.
Through the program, operators purchased more than 8,000 new items, including beds and mattresses, shower chairs and tubs, mobility equipment, lighting and visual aids, sensory rooms, music therapy and ergonomic furniture.

“We are announcing 55 new cases, for a total of 1,121 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 525 are in the Vancouver Coastal health region, 386 are in the Fraser Health region, 72 are in the Island Health region, 121 are in the Interior Health region and 17 are in the Northern Health region.

“In the last 24 hours, we are saddened to report six deaths in the Vancouver Coastal, Fraser and Island health regions. There have been 31 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. The majority have been residents of long-term care. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.

“A new community outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected with an inmate in a correctional centre in the Interior Health region. BC Corrections has implemented response protocols and the inmate has been isolated.

“The Provincial Health Services Authority, which is responsible for health care in B.C.’s correctional centres, is working with the Interior public health team to investigate and undertake contact tracing.

“There have been no new reported cases in long-term care and assisted living facilities in the last day.

“Residents at long-term care and assisted-living homes are very vulnerable to COVID-19. One of the most important things we can do to protect them, and those caring for them, is to make it possible for workers to provide services at a single location, reducing the risk of transmission between facilities.

“We are working diligently with unions and employer groups to do this, while ensuring that these workers are at least ‘made whole’. They are responding courageously to monumental challenges during this unprecedented time and deserve our respect and support.

“To date, 641 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 149 individuals are hospitalized, 68 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“We continue to see patients with serious illness requiring hospitalization for COVID-19. This tells us that the risk remains high for everyone in British Columbia.

“Without exception, all travellers returning to Canada must immediately comply with the federal government's quarantine order and isolate for 14 days.

“Each of us must also continue to follow good hand hygiene, stay home as much as possible and stay apart with physical distancing.

“In the coming weeks there will be a number of major religious celebrations on the calendar. Just as we have seen around the world, we call on our faith leaders to postpone all in-person gatherings and use the many tools we have available to connect and celebrate with followers in other ways.

“We must stand united and working together, we must follow the orders and precautions we have in place, and we must do all we can protect our province.”

“We are putting in place measures that complement the federal crisis measures to support our most vulnerable populations and ensure they do not fall deeper into poverty as a result of COVID-19,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “This is a stressful time for everyone, but for those struggling to put food on the table at the best of times, it is important that we ensure there are no additional barriers to get what they need to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy.” 

For people in B.C. currently receiving income assistance or disability assistance, the Province will temporarily exempt federal employment insurance benefits, including the new $2,000 Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). These payments will be fully exempted for the next three months so people receiving income assistance and disability assistance in B.C. will benefit from these new emergency federal support programs, without any reductions to their monthly assistance payments.  

For everyone on income assistance or disability assistance who is not eligible for the emergency federal support programs, including the CERB, the Province will provide an automatic $300-monthly COVID-19 crisis supplement for the next three months. This supplement will also be provided to low-income seniors who receive the B.C. Senior’s Supplement and recipients of income assistance or disability assistance who reside in special care facilities.

With the current provincewide suspension of BC Transit and Translink bus fares, the Province will also provide all BC Bus Pass Program users receiving income assistance and disability assistance with the $52 Transportation Supplement for the duration of the fare suspension. This will be included on the next cheque and for each subsequent month while the fare suspension remains in place.

Existing Compass passes under the BC Bus Pass Program will not be cancelled and will remain active during this time, so people will not need to reapply for bus passes in the future. This will also ensure people can still use SkyTrain and SeaBus services that are still charging fares. There is no change for eligible low-income seniors who will continue to have an active bus pass provided by the BC Bus Pass Program.

These interim measures further complement government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.

To further support vulnerable people, the Province recently provided a $3-million emergency grant to Food Banks BC to distribute among food banks provincewide. The grant will support immediate needs to buy and distribute food, pay employees and cover other costs essential to the delivery of their food programs.

Recognizing that vulnerable people in different circumstances face distinct risks, the provincial Vulnerable Population Working Group continues to identify, assess and address the immediate challenges faced by five specific groups – people living on the street, people experiencing homelessness living in encampments, shelter residents, tenants of private single-residence occupancies and tenants in social and supportive housing.

This working group includes representatives from the ministries of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Social Development and Poverty Reduction, Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, Mental Health and Addictions, Children and Family Development, Health, Public Safety and Solicitor General, Finance, Attorney General, as well as Emergency Management BC, the City of Vancouver, the Office of the Provincial Health Officer, BC Centre for Disease Control, First Nations Health Authority, Provincial Health Services Authority, regional health authorities, BC Housing and Community Living British Columbia.

Reducing poverty is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

“We are putting in place measures that complement the federal crisis measures to support our most vulnerable populations and ensure they do not fall deeper into poverty as a result of COVID-19,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “This is a stressful time for everyone, but for those struggling to put food on the table at the best of times, it is important that we ensure there are no additional barriers to get what they need to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy.” 

For people in B.C. currently receiving income assistance or disability assistance, the Province will temporarily exempt federal employment insurance benefits, including the new $2,000 Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). These payments will be fully exempted for the next three months so people receiving income assistance and disability assistance in B.C. will benefit from these new emergency federal support programs, without any reductions to their monthly assistance payments.  

For everyone on income assistance or disability assistance who is not eligible for the emergency federal support programs, including the CERB, the Province will provide an automatic $300-monthly COVID-19 crisis supplement for the next three months. This supplement will also be provided to low-income seniors who receive the B.C. Senior’s Supplement and recipients of income assistance or disability assistance who reside in special care facilities.

With the current provincewide suspension of BC Transit and Translink bus fares, the Province will also provide all BC Bus Pass Program users receiving income assistance and disability assistance with the $52 Transportation Supplement for the duration of the fare suspension. This will be included on the next cheque and for each subsequent month while the fare suspension remains in place.

Existing Compass passes under the BC Bus Pass Program will not be cancelled and will remain active during this time, so people will not need to reapply for bus passes in the future. This will also ensure people can still use SkyTrain and SeaBus services that are still charging fares. There is no change for eligible low-income seniors who will continue to have an active bus pass provided by the BC Bus Pass Program.

These interim measures further complement government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.

To further support vulnerable people, the Province recently provided a $3-million emergency grant to Food Banks BC to distribute among food banks provincewide. The grant will support immediate needs to buy and distribute food, pay employees and cover other costs essential to the delivery of their food programs.

Recognizing that vulnerable people in different circumstances face distinct risks, the provincial Vulnerable Population Working Group continues to identify, assess and address the immediate challenges faced by five specific groups – people living on the street, people experiencing homelessness living in encampments, shelter residents, tenants of private single-residence occupancies and tenants in social and supportive housing.

The order is being introduced because a number of essential service business owners identified challenges with their insurance as a result of the pandemic. The changes government is implementing are intended to assist with some of these concerns.

For example, a child care provider will not be liable for a child in their care or a family member being exposed to COVID-19, so long as they are following established protocols on how to prevent the spread of the virus, like proper handwashing, regular cleaning and disinfecting and identifying children who are sick.

Essential service providers who are not compliant with respective authorities or who are grossly negligent will not receive protection under the order and will be held liable for damages. The order only applies to situations related to COVID-19 and will remain in effect for as long as the state of emergency remains in place. Additionally, it will continue to protect essential service providers until any relevant limitation periods have expired.

The Province, in consultation with Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has defined the essential services British Columbians rely on in their daily lives in the context of COVID-19 response and recovery. This is distinct from essential service designations under the Province's Labour Relations Code.

“Our government is taking steps to ensure post-secondary students get some emergency support so they can focus on staying healthy, meet their educational goals and finish their semester,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “We heard from students who are facing extremely difficult situations, and we’re moving quickly to ensure they have access to immediate financial relief.”

The $3.5-million investment will supplement existing student emergency financial assistance. This funding will support domestic B.C. students who are experiencing an unexpected financial emergency that may affect their ability to finish their studies and handle expenses. This non-repayable emergency assistance can be used to help with a broad range of costs, including living expenses, food, travel, portable computers and other supports for students who are not already able to study remotely.

Each year, the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training invests $100,000 in public post-secondary institutions for student emergency assistance. This investment represents a significant boost to the existing supports to help students who may be experiencing financial hardships.

Students who attend one of B.C.’s 25 public post-secondary institutions can access these funds by contacting their school’s financial aid office, which will assist with the application process. Each post-secondary institution will determine the specific amount a student can receive based on their individual needs.

Quick Facts:

In the academic year 2018-19, the Province helped 446 students through its annual emergency assistance funding.
International and out-of-province students face unique challenges. The ministry is working directly with public post-secondary institutions to ensure emergency assistance is provided.

“COVID-19 is not only a public-health challenge, but also an economic one. People and businesses urgently need support,” said Premier John Horgan. “We will be there to protect people’s health and give immediate relief during the crisis. This task force will help us keep in close contact with community leaders to ensure the steps we are taking now are working and to plan for a long-term economic recovery after the crisis has passed.”  

The task force, which will help advise the cross-government economic response to the COVID-19 crisis, will take the form of a weekly conference call between Premier Horgan; Carole James, Minister of Finance; Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness; other members of cabinet and leaders from business organizations, including the Business Council of B.C., BC Chamber of Commerce, Vancouver Board of Trade, Surrey Board of Trade, the BC Federation of Labour, First Nations organizations and the not-for-profit sector. After an introductory conference call last week, the task force will begin its work starting Thursday, April 2, 2020.

The task force will help ensure the benefits of provincial programs are reaching their intended targets and complement federal programs, and discuss ways to ensure the best possible information is available to workers and member organizations. 

It will also explore issues around the designation of essential and critical services; child care and other supports for essential workers, and safe workplace operations for businesses operating now, as well as those restarting after the crisis. 

Importantly, the task force will begin to discuss long-term economic recovery following COVID-19. It will provide participants the opportunity to advise government on economic impacts in their sectors and solutions for long-term economic recovery. 

“COVID-19 is a huge challenge, but British Columbians can be assured their government has their back – and together we will get through this,” Premier Horgan said.",

“We are announcing 53 new cases, for a total of 1,066 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 497 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 367 are in the Fraser Health region, 72 are in the Island Health region, 114 are in the Interior Health region and 16 are in the Northern Health region.

“In the last 24 hours, we must also report one death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 25 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. Our condolences to everyone who has lost loved ones.

“We continue to see new cases in long-term care and assisted-living facilities. There are now COVID-19 cases in 21 facilities in B.C., all in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols at all sites.  

“To date, 606 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 142 individuals are currently hospitalized, 67 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“This is an incredibly challenging time for all of us. Along with the serious health risks of COVID-19, many are also facing financial hardship and mental health struggles.

“We know, without a doubt, that with all of us working together, we will get through this. Our goal is to have the restrictions and orders in place for as short a time as possible.

“Maintaining strong social connections – at a distance – is one of the best ways that we can take care of ourselves and show support for each other.

“The 7 p.m. cheer is heard across our province each evening. We have seen flowers and groceries on door steps, young children on virtual playdates, teens hosting gaming marathons and countless other examples of community connection.

“We have also received hundreds of offers of support from those with supplies of personal protection equipment and medical supplies.

“A new joint government-business COVID-19 Supply Hub launched today to fast-track sourcing and delivery of supplies to our front-line health workers.

“Global Affairs Canada has registered tens of thousands of Canadian passport holders looking to come home from countries heavily impacted by COVID-19, some starting later this week.

“All travellers arriving in British Columbia must immediately comply with federal quarantine orders. There must be no ambiguity from the federal government. They must make the order clear and support its enforcement with an increased presence at every port of entry to our country.

“All of us have to step up our game now.”

“We are facing unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19. People are out of work, and businesses are facing tough choices about whether they can stay open,” said Premier John Horgan. “Giving people relief on their power bills lets them focus on the essentials, while helping businesses and encouraging critical industry to keep operating.”

BC Hydro will offer new, targeted bill relief to provide immediate help to those most in need.

Residential customers who have lost their jobs or are unable to work as a result of COVID-19 will receive a credit to help cover the cost of their electricity bills. The credit will be three times their average monthly bill over the past year at their home and does not have to be repaid.

Small businesses that have been forced to close due to COVID-19 will have their power bills forgiven for three months. BC Hydro is waiving bills for these customers from April to June 2020.

Major industries, like pulp and paper mills and mines, will have the opportunity to defer 50% of their bill payments for three months.

“People who have lost their jobs or are unable to work due to COVID-19 shouldn’t have to choose between paying their rent or mortgage and paying their hydro bill,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “These measures will also provide relief to small businesses such as restaurants and retail shops who have had to close during COVID-19, and support them in reopening once the pandemic has passed.”

In addition to this new targeted bill relief, BC Hydro rates will be reduced by 1% on April 1, 2020, after the B.C. Utilities Commission provided interim approval of the application BC Hydro submitted last August. This is the first rate decrease in decades.

“We recognize the financial stress many of our customers are facing after losing their job or having to close their business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Chris O'Riley, president and chief executive officer, BC Hydro. “We hope that not having to worry about their electricity costs for a few months will help provide some temporary relief during these challenging times.”

On March 13, 2020, BC Hydro introduced its COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program to provide residential and commercial customers with the option to defer payments or arrange a flexible payment plan to help pay their BC Hydro bills.

Quick Facts:

The average residential customer’s bill is $159 per month, so the average credit provided will be $477. Some customers may also be eligible for BC Hydro's existing Customer Crisis Fund, which provides access to grants of up to $600 to pay their bills.
The average bill savings for small businesses who qualify will be $121 per month, so the average total bill savings will be $363.
BC Hydro has halted all service disconnections for non-payment during COVID-19 and cancelled all non-emergency planned power outages affecting its customers.
The Province’s COVID-19 Action Plan includes a new BC Emergency Benefit for Workers that will provide a one-time $1,000 payment to workers whose ability to work has been affected by the outbreak that will add to benefits that are received under federal supports.
The Government of B.C. is also providing support for businesses through a 50% cut in school property taxes this year and allowing deferrals of a range of tax remittances that complement federal measures like the wage subsidy and interest-free loans.

“We recognize the financial stress many of our customers are facing after losing their job or having to close their business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Chris O'Riley, president and chief executive officer, BC Hydro. “We hope that not having to worry about their electricity costs for a few months will help provide some temporary relief during these challenging times.”

On March 13, 2020, BC Hydro introduced its COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program to provide residential and commercial customers with the option to defer payments or arrange a flexible payment plan to help pay their BC Hydro bills.

Quick Facts:

The average residential customer’s bill is $159 per month, so the average credit provided will be $477. Some customers may also be eligible for BC Hydro's existing Customer Crisis Fund, which provides access to grants of up to $600 to pay their bills.
The average bill savings for small businesses who qualify will be $121 per month, so the average total bill savings will be $363.
BC Hydro has halted all service disconnections for non-payment during COVID-19 and cancelled all non-emergency planned power outages affecting its customers.
The Province’s COVID-19 Action Plan includes a new BC Emergency Benefit for Workers that will provide a one-time $1,000 payment to workers whose ability to work has been affected by the outbreak that will add to benefits that are received under federal supports.
The Government of B.C. is also providing support for businesses through a 50% cut in school property taxes this year and allowing deferrals of a range of tax remittances that complement federal measures like the wage subsidy and interest-free loans.

BC Hydro will offer new, targeted bill relief to provide immediate help to those most in need.

Residential customers who have lost their jobs or are unable to work as a result of COVID-19 will receive a credit to help cover the cost of their electricity bills. The credit will be three times their average monthly bill over the past year at their home and does not have to be repaid.

Small businesses that have been forced to close due to COVID-19 will have their power bills forgiven for three months. BC Hydro is waiving bills for these customers from April to June 2020.

Major industries, like pulp and paper mills and mines, will have the opportunity to defer 50% of their bill payments for three months.

“Government invests more than $50 million annually to make sure everyone has opportunities to participate in and enjoy the benefits of sport.

“COVID-19 and the need for physical distancing has had a significant impact on everyone, including those in the sport sector. B.C.’s sport leaders responded quickly to the orders, direction and recommendations from the provincial health officer and cancelled tournaments, training schedules and other activities to protect people’s health. We understand this has had a significant impact on the province’s athletes, coaches, officials, sport organization staff and volunteers.

“Starting in April 2020, the Province, through viaSport, will provide provincial, disability and multi-sport organizations with the ability to access $5 million, which represents 50% of their annual 2020-21 provincial funding allocation, to provide these organizations with access to cashflow sooner.

“Sport plays a powerful role in helping people lead healthy, productive lives and contributes to the health and wellness of our communities. These measures are what we can do right away within the existing sport sector budget to help organizations during the pandemic. This is a first step and we will have more to announce regarding additional supports for the sector in the weeks ahead.”

The Ministry of Education has secured and funded licences for the application Zoom for all K-12 public and independent schools in B.C. This will allow consistent access for educators who choose to use it, giving them more ways to communicate with students and parents.  

Continued learning will vary for each school depending on the needs of students. Some options include online learning tools and/or resource packages or assignments emailed or mailed from teachers to parents. For educators who choose to offer online learning, Zoom gives them a common, consistent platform to communicate and share lessons with their students.

To ensure safety and privacy for students, the licensing agreement complies with B.C.’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. School technology administrators can control permissions and privileges, while disabling features that are unnecessary or inappropriate. Students will be given a unique website address, so they can access their virtual classroom without needing an individual account. The Zoom server will be based in Canada, with added encryption so it is a safe platform to learn.

Educators will receive access to Zoom through their school districts this month, along with simple instructions about how to use the software.  

While teachers and schools will have primary responsibility for continuous learning, government also launched Keep Learning BC on March 27, 2020: www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning

This is a central place where families can find ideas for everyday educational activities, links to free learning resources, as well as how to help children learn and how to ensure their well-being while they are at home. The websites will be updated on a regular basis with new materials. As of March 31, 2020, more than 136,000 visitors have accessed the Keep Learning BC website – an average of 33,786 a day.

Since there are many students who will have challenges working online, schools have also been directed to look at alternative approaches for continued learning that will fit with the individual needs and circumstances of their communities. Some school districts may also loan computer equipment or devices to support students while they learn from home.

Quick Fact:

A new ministerial order under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act enables the broader use of communications tools during the pandemic.

The COVID-19 Supply Hub provides a single point of entry to triage and prioritize the thousands of offers and donations for essential supplies from business and other organizations since the onset of the COVID-19 response.

“In this provincial state of emergency, partnership and co-ordination are critical to keep our front-line workers safe and support our COVID-19 response and recovery,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. ""Launching the COVID-19 Supply Hub is an important step in maintaining our supply chain and making sure essential goods and services are getting where they need to go, and fast.”

Premier John Horgan said, “This made-in-B.C. innovation showcases how important it is to work together to support our front-line workers. By giving B.C. businesses a platform to help, we are enabling some of our best and brightest minds to meet the demands of this pandemic and help keep people safe.”

Developed by local B.C. tech company Traction on Demand and built on the Salesforce platform, the COVID-19 Supply Hub will make the types and specifications of critical supplies needed publicly available. From there, proposals can be quickly and efficiently managed and evaluated, so the right products get to the right workers on the front lines as efficiently as possible.

The COVID-19 Supply Hub’s initial focus is on sourcing supplies for the health-care system and front-line workers, though government is also accepting offers for other essentials, like cleaning supplies.

The COVID-19 Supply Hub will be managed under the new Provincial Supply Coordination Unit at Emergency Management BC in partnership with the Provincial Health Services Authority as part of the Province’s cross-government approach to COVID-19 response and recovery.

“This initiative demonstrates how tech can be used quickly to make a difference in people’s lives,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “I am incredibly proud of the leading-edge work being done by the Digital Technology Supercluster, the business community and companies like Traction on Demand. They are finding unique ways to help front-line workers meet the needs of those impacted the most by COVID-19.”

Sue Paish, CEO, Digital Technology Supercluster, said, “From concept to actualization within one week, the supply hub is illustrative of the Supercluster’s ability to harness our community’s power of collaboration. We are moving at an unprecedented pace to meet the demands of this pandemic, with innovative solutions. The supply hub will make a difference and address critical needs.”

Companies looking to offer support or supplies through the COVID-19 Supplier Hub can access it here: www.gov.bc.ca/supplyhub

Quick Facts:

The Provincial Supply Coordination Unit was established under the provincial state of emergency to support the Province’s response and recovery to COVID-19.
The COVID-19 Supply Hub is complementary to existing provincial procurement streams in order to expedite medical supplies under the provincial state of emergency. The supply hub will work in co-ordination with other provincial and federal initiatives to secure medical and other essential supplies.
COVID-19 Supply Hub partners: the Business Council of British Columbia, the Digital Technology Supercluster, Salesforce, Traction on Demand, the Provincial Health Services Authority, the Ministry of Citizens’ Services, the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General and the Ministry of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness.
The Digital Technology Supercluster is led by global companies such as MDA, Microsoft, Telus, Teck Resources Limited, Mosaic Forest Management, LifeLabs and Terramera, and B.C.'s tech industry leaders such as D-Wave Systems, Finger Food Advanced Technology Group, and LlamaZOO. Members also include the Province of British Columbia and B.C. post-secondary institutions. A full list of members can be found here: https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/members-2/

There are early signs that our actions are making a difference, and we can’t stop now.”

Using the extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act, Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has issued a series of orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government. Through these orders, the Province is taking an active role in co-ordinating the supply chain for essential goods and services, supporting the enforcement of the provincial health officer’s orders and prohibiting the secondary selling of essential goods and supplies.

providing people and organizations in the arts sector with a $3-million Arts and Culture Resilience Supplement to be administered by the BC Arts Council.

We’re working hard to alleviate the pressures that we’re all facing, and we will get through this together.”

The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18 after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency.

The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and physical distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. The call line is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., in 110 languages. People with questions related to their health and COVID-19 should call 811.

“We are announcing 43 new cases, for a total of 1,013 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 476 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 348 are in the Fraser Health region, 67 are in the Island Health region, 107 are in the Interior Health region and 15 are in the Northern Heath region.

“It is with sadness that we report five deaths in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions in the last 24 hours, for a total of 24 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia.

“We continue to see new cases in long-term care and assisted living homes. There are now COVID-19 cases in 19 facilities in B.C., all in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols at all sites.  

“To date, 507 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 128 individuals are currently hospitalized, 61 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“We are at a critical juncture in our provincial COVID-19 response. Every British Columbian has a part to play to flatten the curve. We must all do the right thing and be 100% committed.

“No one is immune, but everyone can make a difference. If you are older, staying home keeps you away from those who could put you at risk. If you are young, staying apart means you are preserving important capacity within our health-care system for our elders and others at highest risk.

“The Government of B.C. continues to provide new resources to support British Columbians during this challenging time.

“We are providing our essential workers who are parents a new resource to access child care for children five years old and younger. Starting today, they can register with child care resource referral centres to be assigned licensed child care spaces in their area.”

734,2020-03-31,,Canada,British Columbia,,Child Care Resource Referral (CCRR) centres to reach out to essential workers to connect them to childcare services,Public Announcement,Essential service employees,Not Applicable,S5 Public info campaigns,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020CFD0017-000599,Children and Family Development,,Government Website,Province helps essential service workers find child care,"To support parents who are essential service workers during the response to novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the Province is launching a new process.

This process will match parents, who are working on the front lines of B.C.’s COVID-19 response and have children up to five years of age, with child care in their communities.

Starting today, essential workers can fill out a new “parent” form to identify their need for urgent child care. Forms can be accessed by calling 1 888 338-6622 and selecting Option 4, or online:
www.gov.bc.ca/essential-service-child-care

Child Care Resource Referral (CCRR) centres in 38 communities will act as community-based hubs. The CCRRs will reach out to essential-service workers in their area who filled in the form to connect them with available licensed child care spaces.

Applicants will be asked:

which category of essential worker they are;
their child’s age; and
in which community they need child care.
Child care spaces will be prioritized for children whose parents work in public health and health services, social services, law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. Additional spaces will then be given to families working in other crucial roles, defined as essential service workers.

The number of spaces available for essential service workers will be up to each child care operator, based on its licensed capacity and following any additional health requirements established by the provincial health officer.

Hours of operation for spaces will vary by facility. While many centres are open Monday to Friday, others may offer care on the weekends and outside the hours of 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Government is monitoring whether the needs of essential service workers for care outside of regular hours are being met.  

Child care centres, which are open, are required to follow the child care licensing regulation and guidelines on how to prevent the spread of and protect children and staff from COVID-19. This includes proper handwashing, regular cleaning and disinfecting, as well as identifying children who are sick. Families who want to access child care services must also continue to ensure their children are practising physical distancing with anyone outside of their immediate family circle.

To help the child care sector through this pandemic, the Ministry of Children and Family Development is providing temporary emergency funding to support providers and ensure access to child care is maintained for essential service workers.

Licensed providers that are open and operating are eligible to receive emergency funding at a rate of seven times their average monthly child care operating base funding. Centres will continue to be eligible for the Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative and the Early Childhood Educator Wage Enhancement. In addition, families accessing care from these providers may be eligible for the Affordable Child Care Benefit.

The form and matching process are temporary. They will remain in place for as long as the provincial health officer advises that all parents who can, should care for their children at home and that child care services can and must be provided for those families whose parents work in critical roles.  

The Ministry of Education has been working closely with school districts and independent schools to identify and support children, aged five to 12 years (kindergarten to Grade 6), whose parents are essential service workers, with a focus on public health and health services, social services, law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. School districts and independent school authorities have been asked to ensure students whose parents work in these fields have access to care during regular before-, during- and after-school hours.

Hours of care will vary by school district and independent school. If essential service workers who have school-aged children need before-, during- and after-hours care for their children, they are asked to contact their school district directly. Most school districts have already reached out directly to families through surveys to gather information on urgent child care needs.

As British Columbians navigate these uncertain times together, parents who can are asked to care for their children at home. All children and staff who are ill with fever, have cold, influenza or infectious respiratory symptoms of any kind must stay home. If they are unsure of their status, BCCOVID-19 BC Support App and Self-Assessment Tool and the BC Centre for Disease Control’s online assessment tool can help assess whether or not they can return to child care.

736,2020-03-30,,Canada,British Columbia,,Set up off-site treatment centres (Vancouver Convention Centre - 270 beds and Royal Columbian Hospital - 80 beds) for less acute in-patient care in case situation worsens,Public Announcement,General,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0115-000594,BC Ministry of Health,,Government Website,"Joint statement on Province of B.C.'s COVID-19 response, latest updates","Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:

“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: March 28 to 29, and March 29 through to midday today.

“In the first reporting period through March 28, we had 16 new cases, for a total of 900 cases in British Columbia.

“In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 70 new cases, for a total of 970 cases in British Columbia.

“This represents 86 new cases since we reported on Saturday.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 472 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 323 are in the Fraser Health region, 67 are in the Island Health region, 94 are in the Interior Health region and 14 are in the Northern Health region.

“We are saddened to report two additional COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, resulting in a total of 19 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. This includes the first death in the community as a result of COVID-19, as confirmed by the BC Coroners Service.

“There are now COVID-19 cases in 13 long-term care and assisted living homes in British Columbia. All are in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols at all sites.  

“To date, 469 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 106 individuals are currently hospitalized, 60 of those in hospital are in intensive care and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“We are at a critical juncture in our provincial COVID-19 response. We have two paths ahead: we will begin to see evidence of a flattened curve or our rates of infection will rise even more.

“Our entire government is doing everything we can to address this challenge, and we need every person in our province to do the same. Let us be united in this singular purpose: in these next two crucial weeks we must be 100% committed to flattening the curve and lessening the devastating impacts of this virus.

“While we are watching the epi-curve closely, we continue with the active readiness of our health-care system to prepare for the potential of a large spike in COVID-19 cases.

“A shipment of one million surgical masks has arrived as we continue to restock our provincial personal-protection equipment supplies.

“We have designated 19 major hospitals across the province as primary COVID-19 facilities to deliver care to the most critically ill patients.

“To maximize capacity at these primary sites, we are also readying a number of off-site treatment centres, such as the Vancouver Convention Centre (with resources for approximately 270 beds) and the new tower at the Royal Columbian Hospital (with resources for approximately 80 beds), to be ready for providing less acute in-patient care. In coming days, other health authorities will begin making similar preparations.

“Additionally, in an effort to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, we are suspending pay parking for the patients, staff and visitors at all health authority owned and operated sites, effective April 1 until further notice. This change makes it easier for individuals to avoid touching screens and buttons at payment kiosks that may have been touched by someone previously, and also supports physical distancing measures. Health authorities will provide details on this change of practice at each of their facilities.

“This week, our K-12 educators and students will begin a new form of learning as in-class education remains suspended. The Keep Learning BC website is a new resource to give families additional support and provide guidance on how to incorporate learning into their everyday activities.

“Equally important for families, as we all adjust to the physical distancing measures, is to use the many tools and creative solutions available to maintain the valuable social connections between students that would otherwise be provided in school settings.”

Recently, Henry issued an order under the Public Health Act prohibiting the gathering of people in excess of 50 people at a place of which a person is the owner, occupier or operator, or for which they are otherwise responsible. Employers in the retail food and grocery store sector are asking for clarity about what this means for them.

Retail food and grocery stores play an essential service in every community by ensuring safe and reliable access to food, supplies and other provisions.

Many retail food and grocery store owners have asked whether or not the PHO’s order prohibiting mass gatherings of 50 or more people applies to them. While this order does not directly apply to the retail food and grocery industry, the spirit of the order should be followed. This means that, for example, in large grocery stores where it is feasible to have more than 50 people present at one time, it is permissible to do so provided that appropriate physical distancing can be maintained.

A link to specific guidance is available in the Learn More section. Key considerations include:

enhancing the premise’s sanitation plan and schedule, and ensuring staff are practising proper hygiene. This includes frequent hand washing, only coughing or sneezing into an elbow, and avoiding touching one’s face;
placing hand sanitizer with a minimum of 60% ethyl alcohol in dispensers near doors, pay stations and other high-touch locations for customer and staff use;
ensuring washrooms are always well stocked with liquid soap and paper towels, and that warm running water is available;
providing clean carry-out bags for purchased food and grocery products; customers should not use their own containers, reusable bags or boxes;
posting signs at each check-out indicating that no customer packaging is to be used or placed on check-out counters;
ensuring cones or tape markers are in place every two metres to provide customers with visible queues that support physical distancing;
using physical queue-line controls, such as crowd control cordons at entrances and in check-out lines outside the stores;
do not sell bulk items, except via gravity feed bins or where staff dispense the bulk items;
self-isolation can end 14 days after the last contact or return to Canada if you have not developed symptoms; and
with or without a history of travel, if you have respiratory symptoms that can be managed at home, self-isolate at home for at least 10 days after onset of symptoms. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities.
Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.
Employers should reassess their work environment every day and keep updated with the information posted on the Province’s website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19

The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19. The safety of British Columbians remains its top priority.

743,2020-03-29,,Canada,British Columbia,,$3m emergency grant to Food Banks BC,Emergency economic funding,General,Not Applicable,S8 Fiscal measures,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0049-000583,Municipal Affairs and Housing,,Government Website,Province supporting B.C.’s food banks during COVID-19,"To support vulnerable British Columbians during the COVID-19 crisis, the Province is providing a $3-million emergency grant from the Community Gaming Grants program to Food Banks British Columbia.

Food Banks British Columbia will distribute the money among food banks provincewide to support their immediate needs to buy and distribute food, pay employees and cover other costs essential to the delivery of their food programs. Food Banks BC was selected to distribute the funding because of its expertise in management of food distribution.

“We know that many British Columbia families count on food banks to supplement their weekly grocery needs. To help ensure that people continue to have access to the food they need, our government is taking steps by supporting B.C. food banks so they can, in turn, keep meeting the needs of the people in the communities they serve,” said Mable Elmore, Parliamentary Secretary for Poverty Reduction. “Using funds from the gaming grants program is an example of how government and non-profit partners are working together to respond to the evolving nature of the pandemic, easing the burden on B.C.’s food banks and helping people who are feeling the strain of the COVID-19 crisis.”

Food Banks BC will assess the needs and requirements of food banks to determine the amount and timing of the distribution. Funds will be distributed quickly and equitably to food banks across all regions of the province. 

“British Columbia’s not-for-profit food banks provide a critical service for vulnerable people in our communities, especially during this most challenging time,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “During times like these, we need to help each other as much as possible. This community gaming grant will help relieve hunger and provide support for the people in our province who need it most.”

The $3-million grant uses funding that remained in the Community Gaming Grant’s 2019-20 budget of $140 million after all 2019 community gaming grants had been awarded to or approved for eligible organizations.

“This grant will make a tremendous impact in communities all over B.C. and ensure that food banks can keep their doors open and continue to meet the needs of the vulnerable, who particularly need their assistance at this time,” said Laura Lansink, executive director, Food Banks BC. “We sincerely thank the Province for this encouraging and vital assistance to Food Banks BC.”

The grant to Food Banks BC is in alignment with the ministerial order issued March 26, 2020, under the Emergency Program Act, to protect B.C.’s most vulnerable, making it easier to support critical services for vulnerable people, like food banks and shelters.

In response to concerns raised by food banks about capacity to respond to the urgent need in their communities, the order removes barriers to business to allow: drive-through and delivery opportunities, larger hampers, increased home delivery capability and removes the requirement to present identification. These measures will make it easier for food banks to operate in this challenging time when more people are using their services.

This is one in a series of ministerial orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government for the duration of the provincial emergency.

These latest steps are part of government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.

Quick Facts:

Food Banks BC is B.C.’s provincial association of food banks that represents and supports food banks across the province.
Every year, commercial gaming generates revenue that the Government of B.C. invests in key services.
These investments support organizations in the areas of health care and education, arts and culture groups, sports, environment, public safety, human and social services, as well as parent advisory councils in schools throughout B.C.
Up to $140 million of the revenue generated is directed into the community through the Community Gaming Grants program that supports about 5,000 community organizations each year.

“We are announcing 92 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 884 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 444 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 291 are in the Fraser Health region, 60 are in the Island Health region, 77 are in the Interior Health region and 12 are in the Northern Heath region.

“We are saddened to report another COVID-19 related death in the Vancouver Coastal region, resulting in a total of 17 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia.

“One new long-term care home in the Fraser Health region has a resident who has tested positive for COVID-19. There are now COVID-19 cases in 12 facilities in B.C. All are in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols.  

“Three hundred and ninety-six people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 81 individuals are currently hospitalized, 52 of those in hospital are in intensive care, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“In recent weeks we have implemented strategic restrictions in the province; to reduce high-risk points of transmission, while keeping essential activities going.

“We have ordered citizens to stay home if they have travelled or are ill, and we have urged people to stay apart with physical distancing.

“We have seen countless examples of community goodwill: supporting those in self-isolation, shopping for neighbours and connecting with care and compassion.

“We have taken a step in the right direction, but we know that in the coming weeks, the number of cases is going to continue to rise and our health system will be put to test.

“As a province, all of us must do everything we can to avoid the devastating impacts that we have seen in other parts of the world.

“We must be united and 100% committed to doing all we can to flatten the curve. Thank you for helping to make a difference and now, more than ever, we need you to keep it up.”

“This is a challenging time for families in B.C. as we work together to stop the spread of COVID-19, but it is vital students have a sense of routine and continued opportunities to learn while they are at home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “These guidelines will ensure the needs, health and safety of students are put first as school leaders actively plan to serve the unique needs of their communities.”

While in-person classes are suspended, the B.C. school system remains open to continue to support students and families in a variety of ways. Note that parents should not bring their children to school on Monday, March 30, 2020, as they usually would after spring break.

However, essential frontline health-care workers, like those directly involved in patient care, who need urgent care for their school-aged child the week of March 30 are advised to contact their school principal as soon as possible to discuss care arrangements available during the first week back after spring break. Other parents who are deemed an essential service worker and who may need child care for their school-age children can expect to hear from their school regarding care options by Friday, April 3, 2020. Schools will be doing their best to accommodate urgent child care needs while meeting the guidelines and directives of the provincial health officer.

Since there are many students who will have challenges working online, schools have been directed to look at alternative approaches for continued learning that will fit with the individual needs and circumstances of their communities. School leaders are actively working on these plans, and families will hear from their school superintendent and/or school principal in the coming week with an update on their timelines.

Government is working with all 60 school boards, independent school authorities, First Nations schools, teachers, school leaders, support staff, public health officials and all education partners on a co-ordinated approach. Guidelines for developing education plans for students will follow these principles:

Maintain a healthy and safe environment for all students, families and employees.
Provide the services needed to support children of essential workers.
Support vulnerable students who may need special assistance.
Provide continuity of educational opportunities for all students.
These principles will also guide planning and support for students who need extra learning support or those with disabilities, important services like meal programs and child care services operating on school grounds.

“Boards of education across the province are working on ways to ensure continuity of learning in their communities,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “Local boards of education understand the unique needs in each community. That local connection will be key as boards roll out plans tailored to each school district in the province.”

While teachers and schools will have primary responsibility for continuous learning, government has launched Keep Learning BC. This is a central place where families can find ideas for everyday educational activities, annotated links to free learning resources, as well as how to help children learn and how to ensure their well-being while they are at home. Keep Learning BC is available at: www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning/

The Keep Learning BC website will have helpful guides to maintain routines and stay safe online, giving parents information about how talk to their children about COVID-19, along with other mental health resources to manage stress or anxiety. A comprehensive set of frequently asked questions is also available, with continuous updates about school services and programs as things progress: www.gov.bc.ca/safeschools/

Fleming added, “While it’s important for kids to keep learning, there is no expectation that we can duplicate a normal school day at home, and every family will need to figure out what works best for them, in discussion with their children’s teachers. I understand that many children are experiencing anxiety, while also missing their teachers and friends, and that’s why it’s important they know the actions we’re taking are designed to keep everyone safe, and we will return to regular school life down the road. By working together and supporting each other, we will get through this.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, said, “We are proud of the parents, families and school communities who are working together to keep their children safely at home, and recognize how important it is for children to have continued learning opportunities in these challenging times. Parents who are health-care workers are also eagerly waiting for support, and it’s our job to work as a team to make sure they can continue their essential services.”

Quote:

Andrea Sinclair, president, BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils —

“The BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils is truly appreciative of the united effort that is being undertaken across the education sector resulting in the continuity of an educational program while our children are at home. Parents understand that alternative instruction plans are being created to best meet the needs of children and that learning will vary by grade, district and region. As we try to maintain a daily routine in our homes, including academics and recreation, parents acknowledge that educators play a critical role supporting our children during this extraordinary time.”

Quick Facts:

On March 17, 2020, under the direction of the provincial health officer, all schools were ordered to immediately suspend in-class instruction until further notice. 
Every student in K-12 will receive a final mark for the 2019-20 school year, and all students who are on track to move to the next grade will do so in the fall. Every student eligible to graduate from Grade 12 this school year will also graduate. On average, about 45,000 students graduate every year.
The Ministry of Education is also working across government to ensure all students graduating high school will have a smooth transition to post-secondary education.

“We are tracking the epidemic curve closely here in B.C. We are also monitoring outbreaks in other nations to guide our health system preparations and public health response.

“In the past few days, our upward path has been less severe than other places, but we continue to see steady increases in community transmission cases and continue to be concerned about outbreaks, which could quickly grow and challenge our pandemic response.

“The evidence is clear: with every person in British Columbia 100% committed to physical distancing, we can flatten the curve. Over the next two weeks we must be united in this one goal.

“We strongly discourage any in-person gathering of any size at this time, but rather encourage using the many online options we have available today to stay connected to friends, family, customers and clients.

“We know that our community and farmers markets are an important source of fresh food. We are heartened that, with the support of funding from the provincial government, many markets are shifting to an online model. We remind market organizers that a public gathering order is in place and physical distancing measures must be followed.

“Further, to reduce the potential for transmission and ensure local, B.C.-grown food can continue to reach customers, a provincial health officer order has been issued, effective immediately.

“All occasional/recurring/weekly events where food and other merchandise is sold (e.g., markets, street markets, night markets, Saturday markets or community markets) must only allow vendors that sell food to be at these events. Vendors of non-food items and all other merchandise are prohibited to sell at these events.

“Every day that we stay home and stay apart will bolster our COVID-19 response. This is how we will protect our health-care workers, whose job it is to care for us, our loved ones and ourselves.”

“We are announcing 67 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 792 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 391 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 262 are in the Fraser Health region, 57 are in the Island Health region, 70 are in the Interior Health region and 12 are in the Northern Heath region.

“We are saddened to report two more deaths as a result of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal health region. Our condolences to their loved ones during this difficult time.

“Two additional long-term care homes in the Fraser Health region have staff with confirmed cases of COVID-19, The Harrison at Elim Village and Chartwell Independent Living at Langley Gardens. In total, 11 long-term care homes in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions have confirmed cases of COVID-19.

“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 73 individuals are currently hospitalized, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“We are tracking the epidemic curve closely here in B.C. We are also monitoring outbreaks in other nations to guide our health system preparations and public health response.

“In the past few days, our upward path has been less severe than other places, but we continue to see steady increases in community transmission cases and continue to be concerned about outbreaks, which could quickly grow and challenge our pandemic response.

“The evidence is clear: with every person in British Columbia 100% committed to physical distancing, we can flatten the curve. Over the next two weeks we must be united in this one goal.

“We strongly discourage any in-person gathering of any size at this time, but rather encourage using the many online options we have available today to stay connected to friends, family, customers and clients.

At the request of the Attorney General, the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General has made the order under the Emergency Program Act to protect public health and to recognize that during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, British Columbians involved in legal or administrative proceedings may be unable to take steps required by legislation. 

The order provides that mandatory limitation periods, and other mandatory time periods established in an enactment or law of British Columbia, within which a civil or family action, proceeding, claim or appeal must be commenced in the provincial court, Supreme Court or Court of Appeal are suspended. It also provides that a person, tribunal or other body that has a statutory power of decision may waive, suspend or extend a mandatory time period relating to the exercise of that power.

The order applies during the current state of emergency, including any extension of the state of emergency. ",

“COVID-19 and the need for physical distancing has had a significant impact on everyone, including those in the arts sector. Arts organizations right away responded to the orders, direction and recommendations from the provincial health officer, showing great leadership by cancelling events, performances and festivals to protect people’s health. We understand this has had a significant impact on artists, their families and arts organizations.

“My colleague Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission, and I have been in regular contact with arts and culture leaders to understand their initial needs during this pandemic.

“To support the people and organizations in the arts sector, we have developed a $3-million Arts and Culture Resilience Supplement to be administered by the BC Arts Council. Operating and eligible project clients will receive a supplement of up to $15,000 in early April to help them pay their bills.

“Starting in April 2020, the BC Arts Council will provide operating clients a 50% advance on 2020-21 funding to help with their cash flow. We are also extending application deadlines, relaxing reporting requirements and allowing organizations to use funding to cover immediate needs like rent and utilities.

“These actions build on our government’s COVID-19 Action Plan. The new BC Emergency Benefit for Workers allows people in the arts sector, who have had their income affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, to apply for a one-time payment of $1,000. Our government’s financial support plan includes several actions that arts organizations are eligible for, such as delaying tax filing and payment deadlines.

“This is a first, but very necessary, step. These measures are what we can do right away within the existing BC Arts Council budget to help arts organizations during the pandemic. We will have more to announce regarding additional supports for the sector in the weeks ahead.”

752,2020-03-27,,Canada,British Columbia,,BC Association of Farmers’ Markets to move to online model,Technology,General,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AGRI0014-000569,Agriculture,,Government Website,BC Farmers’ Markets Online opening soon,"During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the BC Association of Farmers’ Markets (BCAFM) is helping member markets move to an online model to continue providing consumers with locally grown and prepared food products.

“It’s important to support your community and each other during this time of uncertainty, and a virtual shopping trip to a farmers market is an easy way to get the groceries on your list and to Buy BC, while ensuring physical distancing measures are being followed,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Moving farmers markets online will help ensure the health and safety of vendors and consumers, while still providing the same fresh and local food that families all over the province count on.”

The 145 BCAFM member farmers markets operating in British Columbia play a key role in many communities’ food supply and support the livelihood of many farmers and their families. These markets are eligible to receive funding to help transition to an online market platform. This will enable them to continue selling their food products to customers in their communities.

“The critical importance and resiliency of local food and farmers has never been clearer than now, and B.C. farmers markets are an essential retail sales channel for British Columbians to access local food and sustain the livelihoods of thousands of farmers and food processors across our province,” said Heather O’Hara, executive director, BCAFM. “Our member farmers markets continue to modify their operations to ensure the health and safety of customers, vendors and market organizers alike, and in further response to COVID-19, our new BC Farmers’ Markets Online platform will offer a new shopping channel for the peak farmers market season this summer.”

British Columbians can find a farmers market near them and see which markets have launched online operations in the weeks and months ahead at: https://bcfarmersmarkettrail.com/

The B.C. government is providing $55,000 to the BCAFM to cover fees for individual farmers markets to join the online platform and set up their digital market store presence. Each participating farmers market will create its own virtual market store to best serve its communities.

The funding is part of the Ministry of Agriculture’s Buy BC program. Buy BC helps farmers, ranchers and producers market their products as locally grown, raised, harvested or produced, making it easy for British Columbians to Buy BC.

As they open, information about active BC Farmers’ Markets Online will be added to: https://bcfarmersmarkettrail.com/
This website will also have up-to-date information on the markets operating in the community.

This will help address immediate needs associated with the impact of COVID-19, so seniors get the support they need to stay safe at home.  

The supports are the outcome of work conducted by an all-party COVID-19 Seniors Working Group co-chaired by Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate, and the ministry. Members of the working group are Ronna-Rae Leonard, MLA for Courtenay-Comox; Janet Routledge, MLA for Burnaby North; Shirley Bond, MLA for Prince George-Valemount; John Yap, MLA for Richmond-Steveston; and Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley.

“This is a trying time for all of us, but especially for seniors across B.C.,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “I am so proud and appreciative of the work that the seniors advocate and all members of the Seniors Working Group have done to build a plan for safely supporting seniors at home and in community through the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The Province is funding the expansion of bc211, a provincewide information and referral service, to match seniors whose support network has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak with volunteers.

Starting today, bc211 will be available to residents of B.C.’s North and Interior, in addition to the rest of B.C., and provide extended hours of service. This service will take calls from people who would like to volunteer to help seniors in their community with basic needs, including grocery shopping and pharmacy drop-offs and check-ins.

“Seniors in B.C. are especially vulnerable to the impact COVID-19 will have on their health and their ability to stay connected with others,” Mackenzie said. ""The outpouring of calls from people who want to help our seniors is inspiring, and using bc211 to match British Columbians who want to help, with seniors who need some help to stay connected and meet basic needs, is a perfect match.”

The funding provided to the United Way of the Lower Mainland will address immediate needs associated with the impact of COVID-19, as well as maintain and expand some existing programs.

“We’re excited to be collaborating with bc211 and the Ministry of Health to deliver these essential supports to seniors,” said Michael McKnight, president and CEO, United Way of the Lower Mainland. “It is important that we support our most vulnerable citizens during this challenging time with local communities and community agencies being essential to these efforts. If you are a senior in need of support, we urge you to reach out.”

Improving access to local support for seniors includes expanding current services and addressing both geographic and capacity gaps, to better serve seniors locally during this crucial time.

Quick Facts:

In 2019, 20% of B.C.’s population was 65 years of age or older. In 15 years, this percentage is expected to rise to 25%.
The information and referral service will gather information and share it with participating local community agencies that will match seniors and volunteers who live in the same community.
The phone service will be available seven days a week during daytime hours and is free.

“B.C. is in a strong position to effectively respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Farnworth. “Informed by the direction of the provincial health officer, we’re taking these critical steps to keep our communities safe, goods moving and essential service workers supported.”

Using the extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act, the minister is issuing a series of ministerial orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government for the duration of the provincial emergency. These include:

Supply chain: Establishing a new Provincial Supply Chain Coordination Unit to co-ordinate goods and services distribution; taking a more active role in co-ordinating essential goods and services movement by land, air, marine and rail; and suspending any bylaws that restrict goods delivery at any time of day.
Protecting consumers: Banning the secondary resale of food, medical supplies, personal protective equipment, cleaning and other essential supplies; and restricting quantities of items purchased at point of sale. 
Enforcement: Enabling municipal bylaw officers to support enforcement of the provincial health officer’s orders for business closures and gatherings, in line with offences under the Public Health Act.
Travel: Ensuring all passenger and car-ferry services provide minimum service levels and priority access for residents, and essential goods and workers.
Protecting B.C.’s most vulnerable: Making it easier to support critical services for vulnerable people, like food banks and shelters.
Co-ordination: Suspending local states of emergency specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, except for the City of Vancouver; giving municipal councils the ability to hold more flexible meetings to expedite decisions; and co-ordinating potential use of local publicly owned facilities, like community centres, for self-isolation, testing, medical care, warehousing and distribution.
These unprecedented steps, made based on the recommendation of B.C.’s health and emergency management officials and invoked for the first time under a provincial state of emergency, will support the provincial health officer and minister of health in a co-ordinated cross-government approach to COVID-19 response and recovery.

Farnworth added, “Many local governments, First Nations and partners have stepped up to make sure they have prepared to protect their communities from the impacts of COVID-19. Today’s measures will make sure communities are taking necessary steps, in co-ordination with the Province, to get ready should more action be required to combat COVID-19.”

The Province, in consultation with the Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, has defined essential services British Columbians rely on in their daily lives in the context of COVID-19 response and recovery. This is distinct from essential service designations under the Province's Labour Relations Code.

In consultation with the provincial health officer, any business or service that has not been ordered to close, and is also not identified on the essential service list, may stay open if it can adapt its services and workplace to the orders and recommendations of the PHO.

“In these new and challenging times we are facing, we’re asking British Columbians to stay strong as a community, and together we can get through this,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “I’m proud of the strategic measures we have enacted government-wide to help our families and health-care workers, to keep them safe and supported. By issuing a series of ministerial orders, we recognize that this is not forever, but it is for now. With everyone stepping in and respecting the extraordinary means we have to take, we will overcome this.”

Farnworth declared a provincial state of emergency on March 18, 2020, after the provincial health officer declared a public health emergency on March 17. The Province previously declared states of emergency in 1998, 2003, 2017 and 2018 – all related to wildfires. In each of those previous declarations, necessary actions were able to be taken without issuing minister’s orders under the Emergency Program Act.

Quick Facts:

Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time.
During the 2017 wildfire season, the Province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

For Immediate Release
Mar. 25, 2020

VICTORIA – To reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of British Columbians, the 2020 BC Summer Games that were scheduled for July 23-26 in Maple Ridge have been cancelled.

“Keeping British Columbians safe and healthy is our top priority. Through conversations with leadership at the BC Games Society, it became clear that there was no viable path forward to host the Games this year and that they must now be cancelled,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “I’m so thrilled that the Maple Ridge Council, BC Games Society, School District 42 and the local organizing committee were able to respond quickly, and that we can now all look forward to the 2024 BC Summer Games in Maple Ridge.”

While the full extent and impact felt from the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown, B.C.’s Health Minister Adrian Dix and Chief Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry have advised to restrict large gatherings, travel and physical interaction. Cancelling the 2020 Games supports efforts to contain the spread of the virus and focus available resources and public attention on overcoming the pandemic.

“It is very unfortunate for athletes and coaches across the province who will not have a BC Games experience this summer, but this is bigger than all of us,” said Alison Noble, President and CEO of the BC Games Society. “We need to respect this issue and take socially responsible action. We look forward to the Games resuming in the future.”

The BC Games are held every two years. Greater Vernon will host the 2022 BC Winter Games and the 2022 BC Summer Games will be in Prince George. The City of Maple Ridge was given the opportunity to host the 2024 Summer Games and on March 24 council unanimously voted in favour of hosting.

“This is the right decision. We stand in solidarity with Minister Beare and the BC Games Society leadership team in putting the health and safety of citizens as the first priority,” said Maple Ridge Mayor Mike Morden. “Working with Minister Beare, the BC Games Society, School District 42 and the local organizing committee we have reached an agreement to have Maple Ridge be the host city for the 2024 BC Summer Games. Our community will be ready to welcome the athletes, coaches and their families for an outstanding Summer Games competition.”

The BC Games brings valuable competitive opportunities for British Columbia’s best young athletes and developing coaches and officials, help volunteers gain skills and experiences and attract local tourism and direct economic benefits to the host community. The BC Games Society will maintain a dialogue with the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture on how best to support Games participants and recognize the volunteers.

Quick Facts:

The Province invests close to $50 million in sport annually, including $2 million to the BC Games Society to support the biennial BC Summer and Winter Games, and prepare future Team BC athletes for the Canada Games.         
Each edition of the BC Games has a direct economic impact valued at $1.6 to $2.0 million.

“We are announcing 42 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 659 cases in British Columbia.

“One additional residential care home now has a confirmed case – a health-care worker at the Broadway Pentecostal Lodge in the Vancouver Coastal health region. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols.

“It is with sadness we share that one more resident of the Lynn Valley Care Centre has passed away. That brings us to a total of 14 people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19. We extend our condolences to their loved ones.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 339 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 218 are in the Fraser Health region, 47 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 46 are in the Interior Health region and nine are in the Northern Heath region.

“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 64 individuals are currently hospitalized, 26 of those in hospital are in intensive care and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“One hundred and eighty-three patients with COVID-19 are now considered fully recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.

“An order is in place prohibiting gatherings larger than 50 people. This is not an order of convenience, but a requirement to protect everyone in our province – especially our elders and those most vulnerable to severe illness – from COVID-19.

“We remind all British Columbians that while 50 is the maximum number, the smaller, the better. Community connection is very important during this challenging time, but it must be done safely, either virtually or with physical distance. Celebrations and ceremonies that bring many people together, including our elders and seniors, need to be postponed.

“With enhanced cleaning and physical distancing precautions in place, we can keep everyone safe and keep many businesses, including all the essential services we need, going.

“There are a number of new resources and tools available to help British Columbians who may have questions about COVID-19. Together, we can make a difference.”

“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: March 22 to 23, and March 23 through to this morning.

“In the first reporting period through March 23, 2020, we had 67 new cases, for a total of 539 cases in British Columbia.

“In the last 24 hours, we have had 78 new cases, for a total of 617 cases in British Columbia.

“This represents 145 new cases since we reported yesterday morning.

“Two additional residential care homes have confirmed cases. One is a health-care worker at the Little Mountain Place residential care home in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and one is a resident in Evergreen Heights assisted-living residence in the Fraser Health region. Public health officials are providing staff support to implement outbreak protocols.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 330 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 194 are in the Fraser Health region, 44 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 41 are in the Interior Health region and eight are in the Northern Heath region.

“In total, there have been 13 deaths from COVID-19 in British Columbia, in large part as a result of the clusters in long-term care homes.

“We are very pleased to report that 28% of cases, or 173 individuals, have now recovered and are no longer in isolation.

“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 59 individuals are currently hospitalized, 23 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“As the escalating numbers across B.C. show us, there is circulation and risk of COVID-19 throughout British Columbia. While the majority of known cases are in the Lower Mainland, no community or individual is immune – whether in the North, on Vancouver Island, young or old.

“We must remind ourselves that the virus can spread with minimal symptoms and that is why physical distancing, especially staying away from people at higher risk, is so critically important at this time.

“Equally important is for all of us to know that, despite the challenges before us, our province and our country will get through this. Let’s continue to join together and support each other.

“We continue to look to the World Health Organization, and other parts of the world with major outbreaks, to learn and adapt our response here in B.C. This is informing our strategy on testing and hospitalization.

“To help British Columbians who may have questions about COVID-19 symptoms, yesterday we launched a self-assessment app. In the last 24 hours, 18,800 users have downloaded it. The online self assessment tool on the BC Centre for Disease Control website has also been used almost 2.5 million times since its launch last week.

“Later this week, we will present our latest epidemiological modelling.”

Parks throughout British Columbia are seeing an increase in visitors, but many people are not complying with the provincial health officer’s (PHO) requirement for families and individuals to stay at least two metres away from others. This puts the most vulnerable populations at risk. BC Parks has heard concerns from the public, RCMP and First Nations, as well as regional and municipal governments about the increase in visitors and is implementing full closures of certain parks throughout the province.

“The mental and physical wellness benefit of being outside during the COVID-19 pandemic response is important, but keeping people safe right now is the most important thing we can be doing,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Until we flatten the transmission curve of COVID-19 and people strictly comply with the PHO physical distancing requirement, provincial park access will be restricted.”

These closures are in addition to a previous suspension of services and facilities in provincial parks, including visitor centres, nature houses, washrooms and day-use areas. In alignment with Parks Canada, all campgrounds are closed until April 30, 2020.  

BC Parks will continue to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely and follow the direction and advice set out by the PHO and the Ministry of Health. Additional provincial park closures may be implemented on a case-by-case basis where and when required. People who still choose to visit provincial parks should be mindful that they are responsible for their own safety and that washroom facilities will not be available.

In addition to the BC Parks closures, the Recreation Sites and Trails BC (RSTBC) branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development is closing its campgrounds and amenities in response to the COVID-19 situation.

“We want to do whatever we can to make sure British Columbians have access to this province’s great outdoor recreation opportunities, but this is an unprecedented situation and we need to protect everyone’s health,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development.

RSTBC campgrounds are generally located in remote areas and provide basic facilities. Potable water and electricity are not provided. The temporary closure includes RSTBC campgrounds where there is an increased likelihood of close contact with frequently touched surfaces, including toilets, kiosks, ticket booths, overnight shelters and day-use shelters. Day-use shelters, backcountry cabins, warming huts, ticket booths at snowmobile areas and other built facilities will be closed.

Backcountry trails will remain open, but maintenance services, including grooming, have been suspended. Trail users are encouraged to use local facilities and not travel for recreation purposes. The facilities accessed by these groups will also remain closed.

The bylaw revisions passed today would allow for $1,000 tickets and prosecution of breaches of the order subject to fines of up to $50,000. 

This bylaw is one tool in the City’s toolkit to help limit the spread of COVID-19. It should help ensure businesses follow the orders issued under the bylaw.  

All dine-in options at local establishments shut down
Last week, the City of Vancouver shut down all dine-in options at local establishments. This is currently the only order under the bylaw. Over the past two days, inspectors visited more than 1,600 restaurants and identified 14 cases of non-compliance with the order.

The City is pleased to see how responsive restaurant owners have been to date and thanks the vast majority of businesses that are taking direction from the City and from public health officials seriously.

Park facilities, playgrounds, and parking lots closed
Some people in Vancouver continue to gather in large crowds at our parks and beaches. In addition to previously-announced facilities and playground closures, the Vancouver Park Board is now closing parking lots at high-traffic outdoor destinations.

Beaches and parks remain open, but may be closed and an order may be issued in the near future if people continue to gather in groups at these locations.

Prevent the spread of COVID-19
All City of Vancouver facilities and service delivery information can be found on our web site at vancouver.ca/covid19.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19 in people should:

Stay home 
Wash hands frequently and avoid touching their face
Maintain a two-metre distance between themselves and others
We appreciate there is a lot of information circulating at this time, and not all of it is coming from verified sources.

Quotes
Mayor Kennedy Stewart
""The time for asking nicely is over,"" said Mayor Kennedy Stewart. ""Today, Council passed new enforcement measures including fines of up to $50,000 for those who continue to believe the rules don't apply to them. This is serious. Now is the time to shut down, stay put, and save lives.""

City Manager Sadhu Johnston
“The intention of gaining enforcement tools is to ensure that businesses comply with orders. We have no intention at this time to ticket people for not complying with social distancing,” said City Manager Sadhu Johnston. “We would prefer that people follow the advice given by public health, and the City’s orders under the local State of Emergency, however for businesses that are not compliant, we will enforce the orders, issue tickets and prosecute breaches if it comes to that. If people ignore social distancing, we will consider issuing and enforcing orders, but that is not underway at this point.”

Councillor Melissa De Genova
“Enhanced enforcement may be needed to help our city achieve 100% compliance with social distancing. Vancouver does not have the luxury of time-the sooner we take action, the better our chances of slowing and stopping the threat of infection, especially to the most vulnerable people in our city,” said Councillor Melissa De Genova. “Vancouver has an opportunity to make decisions based on information and outcomes we are seeing globally. I am pleased by the unanimous support of Council to adjust the Emergency bylaw to allow the city to issue fines of $1000 with the possibility of penalties up to $50,000 for those who do not comply. Although I hope tickets and fines are not necessary, it is important to take swift and serious actions to flatten the curve.”

Councillor Sarah Kirby-Yung
”Council took another strong step today. Amending Vancouver’s State of Emergency By-law to include enforcement powers and the ability to lever fines against businesses for life-threatening non-compliant operations, as well as against non-complaint individuals who flaunt physical distancing requirements, can be a critical tool in the fight to keep everyone healthy and safe,” said Councillor Sarah Kirby-Yung. “This is not a dress rehearsal. It’s the real deal. Everything we do impacts everyone else. Please step up Vancouver and do your part and we’ll come out the other side together.”",
768,2020-03-23,,Canada,British Columbia,,"Permanently provide up to 3 days of unpaid, job-protected leave each year due to illness and injury",Employment Protections,General,Not Applicable,S8 Fiscal measures,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020LBR0012-000551,Labour,,Government Website,Protecting jobs during difficult times,"The Province has made two significant changes to the Employment Standards Act to better support workers both during the COVID-19 public health emergency and in the long term.

Firstly, changes will allow workers to immediately take unpaid, job-protected leave if they are unable to work for reasons relating to COVID-19. This means workers who are ill, need to self-isolate, need to care for their child or other dependent, or whose employer is concerned that the employee may expose others to risk, will be able to take leave without putting their job at risk.

“These proactive changes ensure that no one will lose their jobs for prioritizing their health and safety, or the health and safety of their loved ones and their community,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “Given these extraordinary times, we are ensuring that the legislation provides protections for those impacted by COVID-19.”

The leave will be retroactive to Jan. 27, 2020, the date that the first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in B.C. During this public health emergency, people can take this job-protected leave for as long as the circumstance that requires them to be away from work applies.  

Secondly, to better support workers on an ongoing basis, the changes also provide up to three days of unpaid, job-protected leave each year for people who cannot work due to illness or injury. This is a permanent change to the act that brings B.C. in line with all other provinces in Canada.

“This crisis has highlighted the importance of having permanent job-protected illness or injury leave in place for people in this province,” said Harry Bains, Minister of Labour. “We’re stepping up and bringing in this new leave to support workers over the long term, beyond this crisis.”

While on job-protected leave related to the COVID-19 crisis, workers may also be eligible for financial support through expanded Employment Insurance benefits through the federal government.

Improving fairness for workers and ensuring balance in workplaces are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

“The COVID-19 pandemic challenges our health, our economy and our way of life. People and businesses urgently need support,” said Premier John Horgan. “Our action plan focuses on services to protect people’s health and safety, gives immediate relief to people and businesses, and plans for B.C.’s economic recovery over the long term.”

The COVID-19 Action Plan is government’s first step to provide relief to people and businesses in British Columbia. The plan dedicates $2.8 billion to help people and fund the services they need to weather the crisis; $2.2 billion will provide relief to businesses and help them recover after the outbreak.

B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan builds on the federal government’s COVID-19 economic plan and boosts supports for British Columbians who are worried about paying their bills and staying afloat.

Supporting people and the services they rely on

The plan includes immediate measures to help individuals and families cope with potential illness, financial strain or precarious employment. It also adds funding to key services, such as health care, housing and social services, to make sure they continue to support British Columbians and help contain the spread of COVID-19.

“While this crisis continues, we need to make sure that people are kept safe and that vital services are available to British Columbians,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “That means making sure people can pay their bills, stay safe in their homes and provide for their families during this extraordinary time.”

Of the $2.8 billion allocated to ensure people have the services and support they need during this difficult time, the B.C. government is dedicating $1.1 billion to boost the income of people affected by COVID-19.

A new B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers will provide a tax-free $1,000 payment to British Columbians whose ability to work has been affected by the outbreak. The benefit will be a one-time payment for British Columbians who receive federal Employment Insurance (EI), or the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit, as a result of COVID-19 impacts. This includes workers who have been laid-off, who are sick or quarantined, parents with sick children, parents who stay at home from work while child care centres and schools are closed, and those caring for sick family members, such as an elderly parent. The workers can be EI-eligible and non-EI eligible, such as the self-employed. The benefit will be paid to B.C. residents, in addition to their federal income supports.

The COVID-19 Action Plan takes further steps to boost income supports by increasing and expanding the B.C. Climate Action Tax Credit in July 2020. As many as 86% of British Columbians will see some extra money from this enhancement. Eligible families of four will receive up to $564 and eligible individuals will receive up to $218 in an enhanced payment. This boosts the regular climate action tax credit payment of up to $112.50 per family of four and up to $43.50 per adult.

Together, the B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers and the enhanced B.C. Climate Action Tax Credit will complement federal income supports and help people who are struggling with job loss, reduced income or increased costs through the immediate crisis.

The Province is focused on keeping people safe, healthy and supported throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To support that work, the action plan provides $1.7 billion for the critical services British Columbians need.

The $1.7 billion includes investments in housing and shelter supports, income and disability assistance programs and crucial health services, such as funding for the BC Centre for Disease Control hotline, quarantine costs, lab tests and work underway at the First Nations Health Authority and the United Way’s Better at Home program for seniors.

To support non-profits, service delivery agencies and child care providers, the Province will continue to provide funding even if these agencies are closed or their regular operations have been disrupted. Licensed child care providers staying open will receive enhanced funding to keep operations going. These centres are eligible to receive seven times their average monthly operating funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 75% of a group facility's average monthly operating expenses.

To help people with B.C. student loans, the Province is freezing B.C. student loan payments for six months, starting March 30, 2020. Federal student loan payments are being frozen as well.

British Columbians needing more time to pay their bills can also apply to existing payment deferral programs at ICBC and BC Hydro. ICBC is extending deferrals to up to 90 days. People dealing with job loss, illness or loss of wages due to COVID-19 may also qualify for BC Hydro’s Customer Crisis Fund grant program for up to $600.

Supporting businesses

British Columbia has a strong economic foundation, but COVID-19 is having impacts across the country and around the world. Every aspect of B.C.’s economy will be touched by this pandemic. The COVID-19 Action Plan will help businesses get through the immediate crisis and lay the groundwork needed to get businesses back on their feet once the crisis is over.

Effective immediately, businesses with a payroll over $500,000 can defer their employer health tax payments until Sept. 30, 2020. Businesses with a payroll under this threshold are already exempt from the tax.

In addition to the employer health tax, the Province is extending tax filing and payment deadlines for the provincial sales tax (PST), municipal and regional district tax on short-term accommodation, tobacco tax, motor fuel tax and carbon tax until Sept. 30, 2020. The scheduled April 1 increase to the provincial carbon tax, as well as the new PST registration requirements on e-commerce and the implementation of PST on sweetened carbonated drinks, will be delayed and their timing will be reviewed by Sept. 30, 2020.

Business and light- and major-industry property classes will see their school tax cut in half. This will provide $500 million in immediate relief for business that own their property and allow commercial landlords to immediately pass savings on to their tenants in triple-net leases.

In the longer term, the recovery plan will dedicate funding to particularly hard-hit parts of the economy, such as the tourism, hospitality and culture sectors. The B.C. government is partnering with business and labour leaders to build an economic stimulus plan. The Province has allocated $1.5 billion for economic recovery.

Effective immediately, businesses with a payroll over $500,000 can defer their employer health tax payments until Sept. 30, 2020. Businesses with a payroll under this threshold are already exempt from the tax.

In addition to the employer health tax, the Province is extending tax filing and payment deadlines for the provincial sales tax (PST), municipal and regional district tax on short-term accommodation, tobacco tax, motor fuel tax and carbon tax until Sept. 30, 2020. The scheduled April 1 increase to the provincial carbon tax, as well as the new PST registration requirements on e-commerce and the implementation of PST on sweetened carbonated drinks, will be delayed and their timing will be reviewed by Sept. 30, 2020.

Business and light- and major-industry property classes will see their school tax cut in half. This will provide $500 million in immediate relief for business that own their property and allow commercial landlords to immediately pass savings on to their tenants in triple-net leases.

In the longer term, the recovery plan will dedicate funding to particularly hard-hit parts of the economy, such as the tourism, hospitality and culture sectors. The B.C. government is partnering with business and labour leaders to build an economic stimulus plan. The Province has allocated $1.5 billion for economic recovery.

“The COVID-19 pandemic challenges our health, our economy and our way of life. People and businesses urgently need support,” said Premier John Horgan. “Our action plan focuses on services to protect people’s health and safety, gives immediate relief to people and businesses, and plans for B.C.’s economic recovery over the long term.”

The COVID-19 Action Plan is government’s first step to provide relief to people and businesses in British Columbia. The plan dedicates $2.8 billion to help people and fund the services they need to weather the crisis; $2.2 billion will provide relief to businesses and help them recover after the outbreak.

B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan builds on the federal government’s COVID-19 economic plan and boosts supports for British Columbians who are worried about paying their bills and staying afloat.

Supporting people and the services they rely on

The plan includes immediate measures to help individuals and families cope with potential illness, financial strain or precarious employment. It also adds funding to key services, such as health care, housing and social services, to make sure they continue to support British Columbians and help contain the spread of COVID-19.

“While this crisis continues, we need to make sure that people are kept safe and that vital services are available to British Columbians,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “That means making sure people can pay their bills, stay safe in their homes and provide for their families during this extraordinary time.”

Of the $2.8 billion allocated to ensure people have the services and support they need during this difficult time, the B.C. government is dedicating $1.1 billion to boost the income of people affected by COVID-19.

A new B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers will provide a tax-free $1,000 payment to British Columbians whose ability to work has been affected by the outbreak. The benefit will be a one-time payment for British Columbians who receive federal Employment Insurance (EI), or the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit, as a result of COVID-19 impacts. This includes workers who have been laid-off, who are sick or quarantined, parents with sick children, parents who stay at home from work while child care centres and schools are closed, and those caring for sick family members, such as an elderly parent. The workers can be EI-eligible and non-EI eligible, such as the self-employed. The benefit will be paid to B.C. residents, in addition to their federal income supports.

The COVID-19 Action Plan takes further steps to boost income supports by increasing and expanding the B.C. Climate Action Tax Credit in July 2020. As many as 86% of British Columbians will see some extra money from this enhancement. Eligible families of four will receive up to $564 and eligible individuals will receive up to $218 in an enhanced payment. This boosts the regular climate action tax credit payment of up to $112.50 per family of four and up to $43.50 per adult.

Together, the B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers and the enhanced B.C. Climate Action Tax Credit will complement federal income supports and help people who are struggling with job loss, reduced income or increased costs through the immediate crisis.

The Province is focused on keeping people safe, healthy and supported throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To support that work, the action plan provides $1.7 billion for the critical services British Columbians need.

The $1.7 billion includes investments in housing and shelter supports, income and disability assistance programs and crucial health services, such as funding for the BC Centre for Disease Control hotline, quarantine costs, lab tests and work underway at the First Nations Health Authority and the United Way’s Better at Home program for seniors.

To support non-profits, service delivery agencies and child care providers, the Province will continue to provide funding even if these agencies are closed or their regular operations have been disrupted. Licensed child care providers staying open will receive enhanced funding to keep operations going. These centres are eligible to receive seven times their average monthly operating funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 75% of a group facility's average monthly operating expenses.

To help people with B.C. student loans, the Province is freezing B.C. student loan payments for six months, starting March 30, 2020. Federal student loan payments are being frozen as well.

British Columbians needing more time to pay their bills can also apply to existing payment deferral programs at ICBC and BC Hydro. ICBC is extending deferrals to up to 90 days. People dealing with job loss, illness or loss of wages due to COVID-19 may also qualify for BC Hydro’s Customer Crisis Fund grant program for up to $600.

“The COVID-19 pandemic challenges our health, our economy and our way of life. People and businesses urgently need support,” said Premier John Horgan. “Our action plan focuses on services to protect people’s health and safety, gives immediate relief to people and businesses, and plans for B.C.’s economic recovery over the long term.”

The COVID-19 Action Plan is government’s first step to provide relief to people and businesses in British Columbia. The plan dedicates $2.8 billion to help people and fund the services they need to weather the crisis; $2.2 billion will provide relief to businesses and help them recover after the outbreak.

B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan builds on the federal government’s COVID-19 economic plan and boosts supports for British Columbians who are worried about paying their bills and staying afloat.

Supporting people and the services they rely on

The plan includes immediate measures to help individuals and families cope with potential illness, financial strain or precarious employment. It also adds funding to key services, such as health care, housing and social services, to make sure they continue to support British Columbians and help contain the spread of COVID-19.

“While this crisis continues, we need to make sure that people are kept safe and that vital services are available to British Columbians,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “That means making sure people can pay their bills, stay safe in their homes and provide for their families during this extraordinary time.”

Of the $2.8 billion allocated to ensure people have the services and support they need during this difficult time, the B.C. government is dedicating $1.1 billion to boost the income of people affected by COVID-19.

A new B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers will provide a tax-free $1,000 payment to British Columbians whose ability to work has been affected by the outbreak. The benefit will be a one-time payment for British Columbians who receive federal Employment Insurance (EI), or the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit, as a result of COVID-19 impacts. This includes workers who have been laid-off, who are sick or quarantined, parents with sick children, parents who stay at home from work while child care centres and schools are closed, and those caring for sick family members, such as an elderly parent. The workers can be EI-eligible and non-EI eligible, such as the self-employed. The benefit will be paid to B.C. residents, in addition to their federal income supports.

The COVID-19 Action Plan takes further steps to boost income supports by increasing and expanding the B.C. Climate Action Tax Credit in July 2020. As many as 86% of British Columbians will see some extra money from this enhancement. Eligible families of four will receive up to $564 and eligible individuals will receive up to $218 in an enhanced payment. This boosts the regular climate action tax credit payment of up to $112.50 per family of four and up to $43.50 per adult.

Together, the B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers and the enhanced B.C. Climate Action Tax Credit will complement federal income supports and help people who are struggling with job loss, reduced income or increased costs through the immediate crisis.

The Province is focused on keeping people safe, healthy and supported throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To support that work, the action plan provides $1.7 billion for the critical services British Columbians need.

The $1.7 billion includes investments in housing and shelter supports, income and disability assistance programs and crucial health services, such as funding for the BC Centre for Disease Control hotline, quarantine costs, lab tests and work underway at the First Nations Health Authority and the United Way’s Better at Home program for seniors.

To support non-profits, service delivery agencies and child care providers, the Province will continue to provide funding even if these agencies are closed or their regular operations have been disrupted. Licensed child care providers staying open will receive enhanced funding to keep operations going. These centres are eligible to receive seven times their average monthly operating funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 75% of a group facility's average monthly operating expenses.

To help people with B.C. student loans, the Province is freezing B.C. student loan payments for six months, starting March 30, 2020. Federal student loan payments are being frozen as well.

British Columbians needing more time to pay their bills can also apply to existing payment deferral programs at ICBC and BC Hydro. ICBC is extending deferrals to up to 90 days. People dealing with job loss, illness or loss of wages due to COVID-19 may also qualify for BC Hydro’s Customer Crisis Fund grant program for up to $600.

Supporting businesses

British Columbia has a strong economic foundation, but COVID-19 is having impacts across the country and around the world. Every aspect of B.C.’s economy will be touched by this pandemic. The COVID-19 Action Plan will help businesses get through the immediate crisis and lay the groundwork needed to get businesses back on their feet once the crisis is over.

Effective immediately, businesses with a payroll over $500,000 can defer their employer health tax payments until Sept. 30, 2020. Businesses with a payroll under this threshold are already exempt from the tax.

In addition to the employer health tax, the Province is extending tax filing and payment deadlines for the provincial sales tax (PST), municipal and regional district tax on short-term accommodation, tobacco tax, motor fuel tax and carbon tax until Sept. 30, 2020. The scheduled April 1 increase to the provincial carbon tax, as well as the new PST registration requirements on e-commerce and the implementation of PST on sweetened carbonated drinks, will be delayed and their timing will be reviewed by Sept. 30, 2020.

Business and light- and major-industry property classes will see their school tax cut in half. This will provide $500 million in immediate relief for business that own their property and allow commercial landlords to immediately pass savings on to their tenants in triple-net leases.

In the longer term, the recovery plan will dedicate funding to particularly hard-hit parts of the economy, such as the tourism, hospitality and culture sectors. The B.C. government is partnering with business and labour leaders to build an economic stimulus plan. The Province has allocated $1.5 billion for economic recovery.

“We are announcing 48 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 472 cases in British Columbia, since we last reported on Saturday, March 21, 2020.

“It is with sadness we share that three more patients have passed away after testing positive for COVID-19: one at the Lynn Valley Care Centre, one at the Haro Park Centre and one a resident of Fraser Health who was receiving treatment at home. That brings us to a total of 13 people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19. We extend our condolences to their loved ones.

“Of the new cases, one patient is a health-care worker at the German-Canadian Care Home in Vancouver Coastal Health and one is a health-care worker at the Delta View Care Centre in Fraser Health.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 248 are in Vancouver Coastal Health, 150 are in Fraser Health, 39 are in Island Health, 30 are in Interior Health and five are in Northern Heath.

“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 33 individuals are currently hospitalized and 14 of them are in intensive care. We are pleased to report that 100 patients have recovered, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“The significant increase in confirmed recoveries is a result of many people who have been recovering in self isolation, with mild symptoms, meeting newly established criteria for recovery.

“Our testing capacity has increased to about 3,000 tests per day, and that capacity will continue to increase this week.

“The number of 811 calls we are able to answer has increased to more than 4,000 calls per day, as a result of adding 12 more nurses and 42 more navigators to our call centres.

“Over the last week, several new physical distancing measures have been put in place around the province, in health regions and individual communities.

“The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated, and everyone must do all they can to support our efforts break the chain of transmission and flatten the outbreak curve.

“Our health-care workers are at the heart of our pandemic response and they face the added risks of exposure both in the community and at work.

“Enhanced screening is in place for health-care workers, as well as clear guidance for appropriate use of personal protective equipment. As individuals, health-care workers must also have a heightened awareness of symptoms and maintain physical distance from others, as much as possible.

“The Province of B.C. continues to put new tools in place to support British Columbians during this challenging time. In addition to the self-assessment tool on the BC Centre for Disease Control website, residents can now download a self-assessment app for their phones.”

782,2020-03-22,,Canada,British Columbia,,Temporarily authorize distillers to manufacturer alcohol-based hand sanitizers,Manufacturing repurposing,General,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0026-000535,Attorney General,,Government Website,Increasing hand sanitizer production to keep British Columbians safe,"Distillers in British Columbia are temporarily authorized to manufacture alcohol-based hand sanitizer to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, through an updated policy directive from the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB).

“We are in unprecedented times and everyone must do their part to fight COVID-19,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Distilleries have been approaching us asking how they can help, and this new policy directive will mean they are authorized to manufacture alcohol-based hand sanitizer.”

Previously, distilleries and other licensed manufacturing establishments would have required discretionary authorization from the general manager of LCRB in order to produce alternative products. However, given the context of the current provincial health emergency related to COVID-19, the general manager is now permitting all distillers to produce alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizers must meet certain federal regulatory requirements.  

Some distillers are donating the “excess alcohol” from their distilling process to a third party that can produce hand sanitizer. Others are producing the hand sanitizer themselves, taking steps to ensure products contain the necessary level of alcohol content to make them effective. Distillers will be able to donate or sell the hand sanitizer they have manufactured, and the authorization will be reviewed on an ongoing basis as the provincial health context changes.

“The flexibility shown by distillers to create much-needed hand sanitizing products demonstrates the leadership of B.C.’s agriculture sector and highlights the additional and unforeseen roles that B.C.’s food and beverage producers can play in an emergency response,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “B.C.’s food and beverage sector has so much to offer, and these displays of businesses changing their operations to help British Columbians in our time of need emphasizes the value each of us add to our communities every time we Buy BC.”

Public health officials would like to remind the public that the best way to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 is by thorough handwashing with soap and water, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds.

Recently, Henry issued an order under the Public Health Act prohibiting the gathering of people in excess of 50 people at a place of which a person is the owner, occupier or operator, or for which they are otherwise responsible. Employers in the construction industry are asking for clarity about what this means for them. 

While this order does not apply to construction sites as a whole, the public health officer is directing employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes:

There should be no more than 50 people in the same space in any circumstances.
Where possible, employees should maintain a distance of two metres apart from each other.
Post signage that limits the number of occupants in any elevator to four people at a time.
Reduce in-person meetings and other gatherings and hold site meetings in open spaces or outside.
Increase the number of handwashing stations and post signage that identifies their location.
Maintain a list of employees that are currently working on sites and update this list daily.
All common areas and surfaces should be cleaned at the end of each day. Examples include washrooms, shared offices, common tables, desks, light switches and door handles.
Self-isolation can end 14 days after the last contact or return to Canada if you have not developed symptoms.
With or without a history of travel, if you have respiratory symptoms that can be managed at home, self-isolate at home for at least 10 days after onset of symptoms. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities.
Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.
Section 4.85 of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation does provide for a minimum standard around the provision of washrooms and hand washing facilities. Where plumbed facilities are impracticable, employers must provide access to portable washroom and hand-washing facilities. Those facilities must be maintained in good working order and must be provided with the supplies necessary for their use.

Employers should reassess their work environment every day and keep updated with the information posted on the Province’s website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19

The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19, and the safety of British Columbians remains its top priority.

“In these extraordinary times, more British Columbians are relying on delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Permitting licensed restaurants to hire their out of work servers to deliver liquor products as part of their food-delivery service allows the public to continue to observe social distancing measures and also offers much-needed support to these workers and businesses.”

These changes will be made available to customers who purchase a meal and the sealed, packaged liquor product for pick up from the restaurant’s premises or for delivery at home. Previously, these licensees were only permitted to sell liquor for consumption in their establishment, unless they had a special endorsement on their licence.  

Existing safeguards for safe consumption continue to be in place, such as verifying identification. The individuals delivering the liquor products will also be required to be certified with Serving It Right, which government hopes will help encourage businesses to use currently laid-off serving staff to make these deliveries. Staff in licensed establishments are already required to hold this certification.

These changes come as the restaurant and hospitality industry have been deeply impacted by COVID-19. The Business Technical Advisory Panel, which consists of representatives of the liquor and hospitality industry, provided this recommendation to help support struggling hospitality workers and businesses during this time.

“A special thank you to the members of the Business Technical Advisory Panel for their recommendations during this public health emergency that has had such a terrible impact on workers in our favourite bars and restaurants,” Eby added. “Government is committed to working with hospitality workers and businesses to identify ways to reduce the impact of this crisis.”

The changes take effect immediately and expire July 15, 2020. The timeline can be amended by government through a regulation change.

“These changes not only help restaurant operators through a very tough time, but also could support the many British Columbians working in our breweries, wineries and distilleries,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Supporting local businesses and choosing to Buy BC makes a real difference in our communities, especially at a time like this.”

“Here in B.C., 55% of all positive cases are female. This is because we have seen younger, female health-care workers with the virus – mainly related to the Lynn Valley Care Centre and other long-term care outbreaks.

“As part of the virus tracking, we look at two curves: the total number positive test results and the date of symptom onset, as determined by the public health investigation of each case.

“We pay attention to the onset curve, because we know that the time from the onset of symptoms to when someone is tested can sometimes several days. This is because people’s initial symptoms may be too mild to consider speaking to their doctor or going for testing.

“As we get more information about the onset of symptoms from patients, the onset curve is updated to reflect this new information.

“To most effectively flatten the curve, and break the chain of transmission, we need everyone to take action at the onset stage. That is why we have put public gathering orders and social distancing measures in place now – to protect us in the weeks ahead.

the development of distinct protocols and identification of sites to support isolation for vulnerable people experiencing homelessness – sheltered or unsheltered – and those in private single room occupancy (SROs) and social housing buildings;
sustaining service providers through continued payments to ensure they can pay their staff and operating costs; and
centralized procurement for critical supplies needed by frontline providers, including gloves and cleaning products.
“Frontline workers are working tirelessly to ensure that vulnerable residents are protected across the province, recognizing the significant added risks that vulnerable people face in the context of the COVID-19 crisis,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are committed to making sure these frontline workers have the support they need to do their job – whether that’s in the form of safe spaces for people who need isolation or personal protective equipment for staff working in the field. We are all in this together.”

Recognizing that vulnerable people in different circumstances face distinct risks, a provincial Vulnerable Population Working Group is working to identify, assess and address the immediate challenges faced in particular by five groups – people living on the street, people experiencing homelessness living in encampments, shelter residents, tenants of private SROs and tenants in social and supportive housing buildings.

This working group includes representatives from the ministries of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Social Development and Poverty Reduction, Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, Mental Health and Addictions, Children and Family Development, Health, as well as Emergency Management BC, the City of Vancouver, the Office of the Provincial Health Officer, local health authorities, BC Housing and Community Living BC.

Isolation protocols are being developed in partnership with local governments and health authorities based on the needs of vulnerable residents in each region. While in some situations self-isolation may be possible within a unit, additional locations have been identified throughout the province for those situations where off-site isolation of one or more people is required. In addition, recognizing that many providers have identified difficulty in sourcing necessary medical and cleaning supplies, BC Housing is now procuring personal protective equipment needed by frontline workers on a central basis and is distributing them directly to housing providers.

“While all of us are feeling the effects of the COVID-19 crisis, there is no doubt that our most vulnerable populations including the homeless and the working poor are disproportionately affected,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “We are working together with our partners at every level of government and in the social services sector to find safe and efficient ways to provide supports to the people who need them the most as quickly as possible.” 

Recognizing that many residents may face challenges in making rent payments as a result of COVID-19, BC Housing has implemented a moratorium on eviction for non-payment of rent in their directly managed properties and is also working with non-profit housing providers around the province to do the same. In addition, the process of applying for a rent reduction is being streamlined for tenants who have lost income as a result of COVID-19, including changing the rules to remove the requirement for proof that the decrease in income is permanent.

People experiencing homelessness often have higher rates of health concerns, and as a result could be at greater risk if exposed to COVID-19. For that reason, enhanced screening and cleaning protocols are in place at residential facilities to reduce the potential that this virus can spread within the building and beyond. To support partners’ efforts, BC Housing is also working closely with the Ministry of Health, the provincial health officer, local health authorities, the BC Non-Profit Housing Association and the Aboriginal Housing Management Association to ensure non-profit providers can protect their guests and residents. This includes providing training and support in encouraging social distancing, best practices in building cleaning and maintenance, identification of on- and off-site isolation spaces, and access to testing and other services.

Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has advised all parents who can, should care for their children at home. She also recognized that while some centres may close, child care services can and must be provided in a safe manner for those families whose parents work in critical roles.

The Province will give centres that remain open compensation to continue operating with reduced enrolment. Centres that close will also receive support for fixed operating costs, like rent or lease payments.

“As a former early childhood educator (ECE), I understand how difficult this time is for those working in the child care sector,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We are working hard with the Ministry of Health to address concerns. We have heard from many child care providers and ECEs who want to stay open to support families and essential service workers at this time. The measures we’re announcing today will give them the support they deserve and the tools they need to continue safely caring for children.”

Child care providers staying open will receive enhanced funding to keep operations going. These centres are eligible to receive seven times their average monthly funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 75% of a group facility’s average monthly operating expenses. Child care centres remaining open will continue to receive ECE wage enhancements for their staff. These expanded financial supports will help facilities stay open, even with reduced enrolment, to support care needs for those parents who need it.

Reducing the number of children in child care centres will make it easier for licensees and ECEs to follow preventative health measures. The Ministry of Health is developing detailed guidelines to inform licensees, ECEs and licensing officers on implementating best practice, which will be circulated to child care providers shortly.

Child care providers who close due to COVID-19 will also receive support to help ensure they are able to pay their fixed costs, like rent/lease/mortgage during the temporary closure, so they can reopen when able. These centres are eligible to receive two times their average monthly funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 20% of an average group facility’s monthly operating expenses.

Smaller home-based child care providers are also eligible for these supports.

“I have received many messages from parents, providers and ECEs as this situation has evolved and this feedback has informed our way forward,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “These measures will provide some financial support to child care providers who need to close until they can return to providing services for families and ensures parents don’t face the economic burden of paying fees for services they aren’t using.”

These measures are in addition to increased federal government measures to support workers through Employment Insurance, the new Emergency Care and Support Benefits, and the Employment Insurance Work Sharing Program, as well as the wage subsidy support for small business. The Province will continue to work with federal partners to advocate for higher benefits for people affected by the pandemic as it prepares to announce further provincial supports for people and businesses.

To support families who may be struggling with loss of employment and income, child care providers receiving these extraordinary payments must not charge parents fees for any periods of closure or for any vacant spaces while they are open, including when a parent chooses to temporarily withdraw a child due to COVID-19.

They must also agree to reserve spaces for families that were accessing their services before the pandemic, even if these families choose to temporarily withdraw, so families can be assured their spot will still be there once the pandemic passes.",

“We are announcing 77 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 348 cases in British Columbia.

“Of the new cases, one patient is a health-care worker at the Dufferin Care Centre, a long-term care home in Coquitlam. Fraser Health authority public health and infection control teams are on site.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 200 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 95 are in the Fraser Health region, 30 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 19 are in the Interior Health region and four are in the Northern Heath region.

“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, six people have completely recovered, 22 are receiving acute care, 10 are in intensive care and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.

“As the number of cases increases and the pressure on our health-care system intensifies, we would like to acknowledge and thank our health-care workers as they support all those in B.C. who require testing and care for COVID-19.

“In step with World Health Organization recommendations, the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control provides clear guidance for all health-care workers to follow. They can be confident that by following these guidelines on appropriate use, we will have sufficient supply of personal protective equipment.

“We need everybody to be aware of the risk in every community and every health region across B.C. And, equally important, because of the incubation period and rapid transmission, the self-isolation and social distancing that we do today will benefit all of us two weeks and two months from now.

“Given the challenges social distancing presents for restaurants, effective immediately, all dine-in food services are prohibited. Restaurants must move to delivery or take-out options only, or close.

“We also want to be clear that while spending time outdoors is important, people still need to stay away from groups in any environment – to prevent bringing the virus into their homes.

“New resources are being made available every day to support everyone in our province as we continue to work to stop the transmission of COVID-19.”

While BC Parks is bringing in some new novel coronavirus (COVID-19) protocols, people throughout B.C. will still be able to enjoy day-use parks as a positive way to connect to nature.

Some day-use services and facilities are currently available at the following provincial parks:

Mount Seymour Provincial Park – access restricted to some lower-elevation trails. Parking and road access are closed.
Cypress Provincial Park – access restricted to some lower-elevation trails. Parking and road access are closed.
Goldstream Provincial Park
Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park
Miracle Beach Provincial Park
Wells Gray Provincial Park
“Nature provides the perfect environment to promote health and well-being,"" said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We are following the advice of the provincial health officer to help people get outside, while ensuring they are following the PHO’s direction and guidance to stay healthy. Our government is taking every necessary step to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We look forward to a time when we can return to full operations at our provincial parks.”

People will continue to be able to day hike and recreate in most all other provincial parks. However, there will be a temporary suspension of services and facility closures as a result of the ongoing provincial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Campgrounds and camping opportunities will be closed and existing reservations will be automatically refunded.

The temporary measures include the suspension of services at marine parks, visitor centres, nature houses, washrooms and day-use facilities. Provincial park visitors may continue to use trails and areas where accessible. Visitors should be aware parking lots in some parks may be closed and gated where necessary.

Provincial parks can attract large numbers, particularly those parks close to urban centres. Visitors should keep this in mind when choosing which park to visit. People are also reminded to keep at least two metres apart from each other during this time. In addition to social distancing, people may need to be extra patient and aware of their impact on the environment. 

Full provincial park closures are also being implemented on a case-by-case basis, where required, to address concerns regarding health and safety. Visitors should be mindful that they are responsible for their own safety and that washroom facilities may not be available in most parks. They are asked to check the BC Parks website for any updates before heading out. Any changes to services at provincial parks will be posted to the BC Parks website: http://bcparks.ca

In alignment with Parks Canada, all campgrounds, camping opportunities and accommodations will be closed until at least April 30, 2020. Refunds will be provided to those with existing reservations during this time.

The Discover Camping reservation system has been suspended for all new reservations. No action is required for people with reservations to receive a refund. Refunds will be done automatically and are expected to take seven to 10 business days. A public notice will be issued once facilities are reopened and the system is able to accept new reservations.

Many tourism operators and other businesses have permits to offer services and trips within BC Parks. This closure may affect the availability of services provided by commercial operators permitted to operate in BC Parks. Park visitors are advised to check with them directly before visiting to determine if there have been any changes to their services.

BC Parks continues to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely and is following recommendations set out by the provincial health officer and minister of health to assess when to reopen facilities and services and return to full operations.

We are taking this step to allow greater social distancing to protect our Coast Mountain Bus Company operators at this time. Customers requiring mobility assistance can continue to use the front doors if needed. Regular fares still apply on other TransLink modes.

TransLink has also implemented the following changes:

Customers will not be able to use seats close to operators on certain buses.
Accelerating the installation of operator protection barriers on buses.
Customers will not be able to use seats close to crew on SeaBus vessels.
Launching an education campaign promoting hygiene and asking customers to allow extra space for fellow passengers and transit staff.
Increasing cleaning and disinfecting on all modes of transit.
As extraordinary social distancing measures are being put into place across the region, TransLink has also seen a commensurate and significant decline in ridership.  This means there are far fewer passengers using the system, which allows for greater social distancing.

“We are announcing 40 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 271 cases in British Columbia.

“It is with sadness that we announce that another patient who tested positive for COVID-19, a resident from the Lynn Valley Care Centre, has passed away. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.

“Of the total cases, 152 are in Vancouver Coastal Health, 81 are in Fraser Health, 22 are in Island Health, 12 are in Interior Health and four are in Northern Heath.

“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 17 individuals are currently hospitalized, nine are in intensive care and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.

“We know that social distancing is an important line of defence for all us – staying a fingertip-to-fingertip distance away from each other, but no touching. Equally important is maintaining our connections with friends, family and colleagues while many of us remain at home.

“We are encouraged by the many innovative ways that people across B.C. are staying connected, while staying apart:

“Virtual coffee dates on your phone or laptop, takeout windows at restaurants, spending time outside with our families, or even dropping off homemade baking or books for those self-isolating. British Columbians are taking the challenge to heart.

“As individuals, there are many things we can do to stay connected. Getting outside in our many parks, walking your pet, or going for a bike ride are all safe. And when inside, take advantage of the many free online resources at your disposal, from virtual learning to exercise classes to reading an ebook from your local library.

“If you are picking up groceries, maintain space when lining up to pay. If you need to take a taxi, sit in the back seat and wipe down the payment pad with alcohol-based wipes before and after paying.

“New resources are being made available every day to support everyone in our province as we continue to work to stop the transmission of COVID-19. And if you are healthy and able to do so, please consider donating blood.”

805,2020-03-18,,Canada,British Columbia,,Tempory suspension of eviction for non-payment of rent and freeze rent-increase,Public Announcement,General,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://www.bchousing.org/publications/Covid-19-Bulletin-for-Housing-Providers-Eviction-and-Rent-Adjustment-Notification-March-18th-2020.pdf,BC Housing,,Government Website,Covid-19-Bulletin-for-Housing-Providers-Eviction-and-Rent-Adjustment-Notification-March-18th-2020,"Temporary Eviction Moratorium and Rent Adjustment Notification
Temporary Eviction Moratorium
BC Housing is asking for your cooperation in putting in place a temporary moratorium on evictions of tenants in subsidized and affordable housing during the COVID-19 outbreak.

BC Housing is committed to preventing eviction of tenants and always considers eviction a last resort. Where possible, BC Housing assists tenants in sustaining their housing during periods of instability.
Tenants in many subsidized and affordable rental buildings are low income households who, if evicted, would likely experience difficulties obtaining housing either in alternate affordable housing or in the private market. As you are aware, many tenants in subsidized housing are particularly vulnerable and face a combination of challenges in addition to their need for housing; it is probable that evictions would tax other social services. This is particularly true at this time, in light of the current COVID-19 situation.

As such, BC Housing is requesting that, until further notice, your organization not issue any Notice to End Tenancies for non-payment of rent.

The process of applying for a rent reduction  will be streamlined  for those tenants  who have lost income as a result of COVID-19. More information is provided below. If there are circumstances where a tenant is in rent arrears, those situations can be reviewed after the crisis is over.

In instances where a tenant behaviour is threatening the life, health or safety of others, or putting tenants or staff in imminent danger, we ask that you complete a full management review and take all circumstances into consideration before deciding to proceed with eviction. This should include the circumstance around the behaviour, risk to tenants and staff, as well as the increased restrictions on alternative housing and access to temporary shelters as a result of COVID-19.

Temporary Rent Adjustment Rules

As we are all aware, many British Columbians are experiencing a loss of employment income as a result of COVID-19. Effective April 1, 2020, Rent-Geared-to-Income tenants, subsidized through an agreement with BC Housing, can apply for a rent re-calculation as a result of loss of employment income with the following criteria:

Any tenant whose household income is in full, or in part, from employment can apply for a rent adjustment if they experience a reduction or loss of employment income as a result of COVID-19.

•	Adjustment can be made for the next rent roll, no need for a minimum income decrease or proof that the decrease is permanent.
•	Rent reduction can be processed for three months.
•	To help both tenants and providers practice social distancing and to streamline the process, the following will apply:
 
BC HOUSING

o	No signature required on Application for Rent Subsidy form. Print out form (paper or from Housing Connections database), write COVID-19 adjustment in the signature block.
o	Income proof waived, based on self-declaration, no proof required.
	If applying for Employment Insurance, based on 55% of previous Employment;
	If not eligible for income assistance, may be eligible for the Emergency Care Benefit from the federal government, based on 55% of previous Employment.
	If actual income is less than our estimate, they can provide proof at a later date and
a further adjustment can be processed.
	If applying for income assistance and household has no other income, the first month can be based on the minimum rent in order to provide time for MSDPR to process the application, then the second and third month should be the Flat Rent.
o	Please enter into Housing Connections if your organization uses online rent calculation, or forward the form to BC Housing for entry.
o	Keep a copy in tenant file.

In order to track costs related to COVID-19, we ask that you keep a simple spreadsheet to track all adjustments and forward to BC Housing upon request once the crisis has passed.

SAMPLE:
Building Name	I Provider Name
Unit#	Tenant Name	Effective Date	Previous TRC	NewTRC
				
				

Important Notice: If some, or all, of your household income comes from employment and, as a result of COVID-19, your employment income has stopped or decreased, please call our office at the number below to discuss options for a rent reduction or other solutions.

After consulting with our public health officials and local governments, I have signed a ministerial order postponing byelections and referendums in these communities so they can focus on protecting their residents.”

In 2020, Victoria and Rossland had byelections set for April 4, and Lytton had a byelection set for April 25. Kamloops had a referendum scheduled for April 4, 2020.

Decisions to reschedule the byelections and referendum will be made by local governments in conjunction with public health officials and Elections BC. Meanwhile, the ministry will continue to work with local governments that are considering byelections or referendums to ensure plans take into consideration the need to protect community residents during this emergency situation.

""We are deeply saddened to announce that a further three people who tested positive for COVID-19 have recently passed away. Two were residents of the Lynn Valley Care Centre and one was a man in his 80s from the Fraser Health region. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.

“We are also announcing 83 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 186 cases in British Columbia. Of the new cases, seven are currently hospitalized, four are in intensive care, five have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.

“Of the total cases, 116 are in Vancouver Coastal, 47 are in Fraser, 12 are on Vancouver Island, seven are in Interior and four are in Northern health regions.

“This steep increase in the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in B.C. is in large part a result of consolidating data this week as our reporting process aligns with the increase in the number of tests that is now taking place in five sites around the province. We anticipate this will level off.  

“The provincial health officer has declared a public health emergency. This is an additional step to ensure our province has more tools available to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

“This declaration enables the provincial health officer to facilitate an even faster response to the rapidly changing situation and enact further measures to protect British Columbians, such as enforcement of orders limiting public gatherings of 50 people or more.

“Effective immediately, businesses with liquor primary licences, such as bars, pubs and night clubs, must close as they are unable to adequately meet the requirements of social distancing. Restaurants and cafes that cannot maintain social distancing of one to two meters between patrons will need to move to take-out and delivery models.

“We also remind British Columbians that public gatherings of more than 50 people – indoors or outdoors – must be cancelled.

“This is the second time the provincial health officer has served notice under the Public Health Act to exercise emergency powers. The first declaration was in 2016, in response to the overdose crisis.

“We would like to remind people that tests are available for all those who need them, but not everyone requires a test.

“To further support people who are wondering if they should be tested, a new self-assessment tool is now available. Before calling 811, we recommend completing the self-assessment at: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/

“We continue to remind people to please use hand hygiene, maintain social or physical distancing, and to stay at home if you are sick or at high risk for serious illness. That includes the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.

“Sufficient physical distancing of one to two meters should be incorporated for workers and customers for businesses and services that will remain open to provide transportation, keep our communities safe and provide essential goods and services.

“For those who have recently travelled outside of Canada and are currently self-isolating for 14 days: leaving your home, hotel or a similar place should only be done for essential errands, such as obtaining medication or food, and with a mask or tissues.

“This is a time to support our friends, family and communities. Purchasing groceries for those isolating or donating blood to support our health-care system are some of the ways you can help. Canada Blood Services has added additional screening measures for increased vigilance to enable the continued supply of blood products for surgery, cancer treatments and emergencies.”

During the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, insurance brokers will be able to conduct ICBC business, such as vehicle insurance renewals, by phone and email.  

“ICBC’s top priority is the health and safety of its customers, partners and employees, and that’s why we are moving forward with emergency protocols to allow brokers to conduct ICBC business over the phone during this difficult time,” said Nicolas Jimenez, president and CEO, ICBC.   

These new procedures will temporarily allow brokers to conduct ICBC insurance business by phone and email. Many brokers remain open for business for people who want to visit in person or for transactions that cannot be done over the phone, such as vehicle registrations and new policies.

ICBC customers will be able to receive the following services from participating brokers:

vehicle insurance renewal, cancellation and policy changes by phone
changes to storage policies (APV345) and temporary operating permits (APV16)
receive transactions by email
submit signatures electronically
submit payments by phone
receive policy documents by email
“With the COVID-19 outbreak impacting brokers’ offices and customers, these provisional changes are the right move to help protect the health and wellness of everyone, while continuing to meet British Columbians’ insurance needs,” said Chuck Byrne, executive director, Insurance Brokers Association of B.C. 

ICBC customers are advised to give themselves ample time for renewals, as the transaction may take longer than usual. Those customers who have questions should contact ICBC at 250 978-8300 or toll-free at 1 800 950-1498.

At this time, there are no changes to driver’s licence renewal protocols, but ICBC is working actively on further options across the board to support customers and employees. ICBC also continues to work closely with brokers through a joint task force on additional online services, including a more permanent process for insurance renewals.

Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, made the declaration based on the recommendation from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency on Tuesday, March 17, 2020.

“Declaring a state of emergency is an important measure to support our provincial health officer and minister of health in swift and powerful response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Farnworth said. “We are working with partners across government and industry to co-ordinate emergency response efforts, and we won’t hesitate to use the tools available to us to keep people safe.”

Declaring a state of emergency allows the Province, through the minister, to implement any provincial emergency measures required with access to land and human resource assets that may be necessary to prevent, respond to or alleviate the effects of an emergency. This includes securing the critical supply chains to make sure people have access to essential goods and services, and that infrastructure necessary in a response is readily available.

The state of emergency is initially in effect for 14 days, once issued, and may be extended or rescinded as necessary. The state of emergency applies to the whole province and allows federal, provincial and local resources to be delivered in a co-ordinated effort.

As House leader, Farnworth is also working to resume the legislature to complete urgent government business to expedite government’s response to COVID-19.

“We are all working together and introducing these powers to protect our people, our health system and our economy,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “These are temporary measures that will help us immensely in the long term. I encourage British Columbians to respect the situation as it stands and remember that each of us has an individual responsibility and civic duty to look out for each other by complying with all emergency orders.”

The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and social distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. 1 888 COVID-19 is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. in 110 languages.

815,2020-03-18,2020-04-01,Canada,British Columbia,,BC declares state of emergency,Declaration of emergency (or similar),General,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PSSG0017-000511,Public Safety and Solicitor General,,Government Website,Province declares state of emergency to support COVID-19 response,"The British Columbia government has declared a provincial state of emergency to support the provincewide response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, made the declaration based on the recommendation from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency on Tuesday, March 17, 2020.

“Declaring a state of emergency is an important measure to support our provincial health officer and minister of health in swift and powerful response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Farnworth said. “We are working with partners across government and industry to co-ordinate emergency response efforts, and we won’t hesitate to use the tools available to us to keep people safe.”

Declaring a state of emergency allows the Province, through the minister, to implement any provincial emergency measures required with access to land and human resource assets that may be necessary to prevent, respond to or alleviate the effects of an emergency. This includes securing the critical supply chains to make sure people have access to essential goods and services, and that infrastructure necessary in a response is readily available.

The state of emergency is initially in effect for 14 days, once issued, and may be extended or rescinded as necessary. The state of emergency applies to the whole province and allows federal, provincial and local resources to be delivered in a co-ordinated effort.

As House leader, Farnworth is also working to resume the legislature to complete urgent government business to expedite government’s response to COVID-19.

“We are all working together and introducing these powers to protect our people, our health system and our economy,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “These are temporary measures that will help us immensely in the long term. I encourage British Columbians to respect the situation as it stands and remember that each of us has an individual responsibility and civic duty to look out for each other by complying with all emergency orders.”

The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and social distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. 1 888 COVID-19 is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. in 110 languages. The 811 number is also in place for medical-related COVID-19 questions.

Appendix A – Essential Workers
Essential workers are people who provide services that are considered critical to preserving life, health,
public safety and basic societal functioning and who have been determined by the leadership of their
organization, on an individual basis, to be critical to delivering these essential services according to the
following principles:
• Preventing new introductions of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into British
Columbia is of paramount importance to limiting the spread of the virus.
• As a baseline, ALL travelers from outside Canada are considered potential carriers of the virus
and should self-isolate at home or a similar place in which to stay.
• To preserve essential services, it is key to consider the risk that a returning worker could pose by
endangering the health of multiple other essential service workers, which could jeopardize an
organization’s ability to provide essential services.
Leadership of organizations providing essential service should require their workers to follow the
required 14-day self-isolation protocol after returning to Canada. Leadership should establish thresholds
beyond which the delivery of essential services becomes impossible and should only relieve a worker
from the requirement to self-isolate if this threshold has been reached. The decision to relieve a worker
must be based on an overall risk assessment which takes into consideration:
o Where the person travelled, recognizing that many countries in the world are
experiencing significant community transmission of the virus
o Duration and type of activity while away (family visit rather than attending an event
involving a large gathering of people)
o Whether the worker or any member of the worker’s household is displaying symptoms of
illness. If a worker or any member of the worker’s household is displaying symptoms of
illness, the worker or member of the household must be assessed by a health professional,
and infection with SARS-CoV-2 ruled out before the worker may be considered for
return to work.
o The work environment of the individual e.g. whether they work independently, outside or
in a group setting, and the risk of the worker transmitting infection to co-workers
Leadership of organizations providing essential services must establish protocols to:
• prevent the risk of transmission of infection to co-workers by a worker with a history of travel
outside Canada
• provide for a rapid response if a worker develops symptoms of illness while at work, and
• maintain high levels of workplace and worker hygiene.
Essential Workers must follow those protocols.

The assessment tool, which was developed by the Ministry of Health, asks a number of questions to help residents determine if they need to receive further testing for COVID-19.

The provincial government is reminding British Columbians that not everyone needs to be tested for the novel coronavirus.

Anyone who is not displaying symptoms, or people who have “mild respiratory symptoms” that can be managed at home – including travellers who have returned to Canada within the past 14 days – are encouraged to self-isolate for two weeks and not seek further testing.

The B.C. government says that the only people who should seek COVID-19 testing are people with respiratory symptoms and who are:

 Hospitalized, or likely to be hospitalized
 Health-care workers
 Residents of long-term care facilities
 Part of an investigation of a cluster or outbreak
Meanwhile, anyone who is sick, or who has symptoms of fever, cough, sneezing, sore throat, or difficulty breathing, is asked to self-isolate at home for 14 days.

For British Columbians who are out in public, the province asks that everyone practice frequent hand washing and to remain two metres apart from other people, if possible.

Anyone looking for non-medical information about COVID-19, including the latest information on travel recommendations, can call or text the provincial government through a newly created hotline at 1-888-268-4319 (1-888-COVID19) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. daily.

for those with urgent matters until further notice. The Court will post further information as it
becomes available, so please continue to check the Provincial Court website for updates.
As of Monday, March 16, 2020
• Family case conferences, CFCSA (child protection) case conferences or small claims case
conferences scheduled between March 16 and May 4, 2020 will not proceed so the parties
do not have to attend Court. The parties will receive notification by May 4, 2020 regarding
the next date they must attend Court.
• All judicial interim release (bail) hearings will use video/audio conferences and teleconferences instead of in-person appearances, unless a judge or justice orders otherwise.
• On Monday, March 16, and Tuesday, March 17, 2020, after hearing submissions, judges
will use their discretion to determine if previously scheduled family, CFCSA, small claims and
criminal trials will proceed on those two days.
As of Wednesday, March 18, 2020
• The scheduling and hearing of in custody criminal trials and sentencings will proceed
unless adjourned by the Court on application by a party.
• All judicial interim release (bail) hearings will continue to use video/telephone
conferences in accordance with CRIM 05 Hearing of Bail Applications (instead of in-person
appearances), unless a judge or justice orders otherwise. CRIM 05 generally provides that
bail applications within court sitting hours are assigned to be heard by judges in the
locations where they are sitting, and bail applications occurring outside of court sitting
hours shall be referred to the Justice Centre.
• Parties are encouraged to apply to use video conference for in custody sentencing and
trials in criminal matters.

notice of a new court date will be sent to the disputant by mail to the address on file with
the Court.

- In custody criminal trials and sentencings;
- Other criminal matters that a judge, on application, determines are urgent;
- Urgent family matters (e.g. restraining orders) and CFCSA (child protection)
matters as determined by a judge;
- Search warrants and production order applications;
- Urgent small claims matters such as outstanding warrants.
Parties must ensure the applicable Court Registry has their current contact information.

819,2020-03-17,,Canada,British Columbia,,Physical distancing of 1-2 meters for all businesses,Social Distancing Announcement,General,Not Applicable,S5 Public info campaigns,,1.0,,1.0,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0089-000505,BC Ministry of Health,,Government Website,Joint statement on B.C.’s COVID-19 response and latest updates,"Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:

""We are deeply saddened to announce that a further three people who tested positive for COVID-19 have recently passed away. Two were residents of the Lynn Valley Care Centre and one was a man in his 80s from the Fraser Health region. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.

“We are also announcing 83 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 186 cases in British Columbia. Of the new cases, seven are currently hospitalized, four are in intensive care, five have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.

“Of the total cases, 116 are in Vancouver Coastal, 47 are in Fraser, 12 are on Vancouver Island, seven are in Interior and four are in Northern health regions.

“This steep increase in the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in B.C. is in large part a result of consolidating data this week as our reporting process aligns with the increase in the number of tests that is now taking place in five sites around the province. We anticipate this will level off.  

“The provincial health officer has declared a public health emergency. This is an additional step to ensure our province has more tools available to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

“This declaration enables the provincial health officer to facilitate an even faster response to the rapidly changing situation and enact further measures to protect British Columbians, such as enforcement of orders limiting public gatherings of 50 people or more.

“Effective immediately, businesses with liquor primary licences, such as bars, pubs and night clubs, must close as they are unable to adequately meet the requirements of social distancing. Restaurants and cafes that cannot maintain social distancing of one to two meters between patrons will need to move to take-out and delivery models.

“We also remind British Columbians that public gatherings of more than 50 people – indoors or outdoors – must be cancelled.

“This is the second time the provincial health officer has served notice under the Public Health Act to exercise emergency powers. The first declaration was in 2016, in response to the overdose crisis.

“We would like to remind people that tests are available for all those who need them, but not everyone requires a test.

“To further support people who are wondering if they should be tested, a new self-assessment tool is now available. Before calling 811, we recommend completing the self-assessment at: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/

“We continue to remind people to please use hand hygiene, maintain social or physical distancing, and to stay at home if you are sick or at high risk for serious illness. That includes the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.

“Sufficient physical distancing of one to two meters should be incorporated for workers and customers for businesses and services that will remain open to provide transportation, keep our communities safe and provide essential goods and services.

“For those who have recently travelled outside of Canada and are currently self-isolating for 14 days: leaving your home, hotel or a similar place should only be done for essential errands, such as obtaining medication or food, and with a mask or tissues.

“This is a time to support our friends, family and communities. Purchasing groceries for those isolating or donating blood to support our health-care system are some of the ways you can help. Canada Blood Services has added additional screening measures for increased vigilance to enable the continued supply of blood products for surgery, cancer treatments and emergencies.”

""We are deeply saddened to announce that three people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recently passed away, all of whom were residents of the Lynn Valley Care Home. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them during this difficult time.

“We are also announcing 30 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 103 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal, Fraser, Interior and Island health regions and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.

“Six people confirmed positive are in acute care, five have fully recovered and all others are self-isolating at home.

“A significant number of new cases are related to the Pacific Dental Conference 2020 held at the Vancouver Convention Centre on March 6 and 7, 2020. We are asking anyone who attended to self-isolate until March 22, 2020.

“Today, we are taking a number of additional steps to address the changing situation in B.C. and ensure our health-care system is best positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“British Columbia’s health authorities are directed to immediately move all hospitals in the province to Outbreak Response Phase 2. This means hospitals will undertake only urgent and emergency procedures and will postpone all non-urgent scheduled surgeries. Hospitals will review operating-room capacity daily to prioritize urgent and emergency cases. 

“Lions Gate Hospital in the Vancouver Coastal Health region is directed to move to Outbreak Response Phase 3. This means the hospital will accept only emergency patients. Lions Gate Hospital is also preparing to open a dedicated COVID-19 unit to provide care to those with the virus.

“These measures will assist hospitals to redeploy and train essential service health-care providers on critical care related to COVID-19 to ensure sufficient medical supplies for patients and staff who need them most, and to further increase capacity to respond to the potential for a surge of COVID-19 patients requiring acute care.

“We have worked with the College of Pharmacists to advise pharmacies to provide patients with a prescription refill or an emergency supply of their medications if needed. This will give physicians more time to care for patients with acute care needs. British Columbians are asked to respect this temporary arrangement and are reminded that there is no need to stockpile medication.

“To further enhance the availability of physicians for all British Columbians, the Province will provide physicians compensation for providing virtual-care services. We have also requested all health regulators to begin emergency registration of non-practising or retired health-care professionals, including professionals from other jurisdictions and the armed forces.

“Further, we are moving to restrict visitors in long-term care to essential visits only. Essential visits include compassionate visits for end-of-life care and visits that support care plans for residents based on resident and family needs, for example, families who routinely visit to provide assistance with feeding or mobility.

“In an effort to allow 811 health-care professionals to support more people who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or who require assistance with other health issues, the Province has created a dedicated phone service to provide British Columbians non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and social distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments.

“British Columbians can reach service representatives seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., by calling 1 888 COVID19. Information is available in more than 110 languages.

“We have also taken additional action to enhance social distancing and limit transmission. These efforts are not forever, but they are important for now.

“We are issuing a new order prohibiting all public gatherings of more than 50 people. This includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious gatherings and other similar events. 

“On the recommendation of the provincial health officer, the attorney general, minister responsible for the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, has ordered all casinos to close until further notice to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This order came into effect 11:59 a.m. today.

""We are deeply saddened to announce that three people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recently passed away, all of whom were residents of the Lynn Valley Care Home. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them during this difficult time.

“We are also announcing 30 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 103 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal, Fraser, Interior and Island health regions and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.

“Six people confirmed positive are in acute care, five have fully recovered and all others are self-isolating at home.

“A significant number of new cases are related to the Pacific Dental Conference 2020 held at the Vancouver Convention Centre on March 6 and 7, 2020. We are asking anyone who attended to self-isolate until March 22, 2020.

“Today, we are taking a number of additional steps to address the changing situation in B.C. and ensure our health-care system is best positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“British Columbia’s health authorities are directed to immediately move all hospitals in the province to Outbreak Response Phase 2. This means hospitals will undertake only urgent and emergency procedures and will postpone all non-urgent scheduled surgeries. Hospitals will review operating-room capacity daily to prioritize urgent and emergency cases. 

“Lions Gate Hospital in the Vancouver Coastal Health region is directed to move to Outbreak Response Phase 3. This means the hospital will accept only emergency patients. Lions Gate Hospital is also preparing to open a dedicated COVID-19 unit to provide care to those with the virus.

“These measures will assist hospitals to redeploy and train essential service health-care providers on critical care related to COVID-19 to ensure sufficient medical supplies for patients and staff who need them most, and to further increase capacity to respond to the potential for a surge of COVID-19 patients requiring acute care.

“We have worked with the College of Pharmacists to advise pharmacies to provide patients with a prescription refill or an emergency supply of their medications if needed. This will give physicians more time to care for patients with acute care needs. British Columbians are asked to respect this temporary arrangement and are reminded that there is no need to stockpile medication.

“To further enhance the availability of physicians for all British Columbians, the Province will provide physicians compensation for providing virtual-care services. We have also requested all health regulators to begin emergency registration of non-practising or retired health-care professionals, including professionals from other jurisdictions and the armed forces.

“Further, we are moving to restrict visitors in long-term care to essential visits only. Essential visits include compassionate visits for end-of-life care and visits that support care plans for residents based on resident and family needs, for example, families who routinely visit to provide assistance with feeding or mobility.

“In an effort to allow 811 health-care professionals to support more people who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or who require assistance with other health issues, the Province has created a dedicated phone service to provide British Columbians non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and social distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments.

“British Columbians can reach service representatives seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., by calling 1 888 COVID19. Information is available in more than 110 languages.

“We are announcing nine new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 73 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal, Fraser and Interior health regions, and were confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.

“Five cases are connected to a cluster at the Lynn Valley Care Centre, one case is linked to travel from Portugal and the remaining three cases are under investigation.

“Public health teams continue to be on site at both the Lynn Valley Care Centre and the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence, working to contain potential transmission to other residents and workers.

“From the outset, we have been proactive in our efforts. Our approach has been to get ahead of increasing risks and do all we can to break the chains of transmission, and we will continue to do so.

“We are adapting our testing strategy to respond to the situation here in B.C. to ensure all who get sick can get the testing they need.

“We would like to be clear that testing is available for all who need it, but not everyone requires a test. If you have no symptoms, mild symptoms, or are a returning traveller and isolating at home, you do not require a test.

“We are continuing to test those who are part of an active investigation or outbreak cluster, those with severe illness who are hospitalized, residents of long-term care facilities and health-care workers.

“We ask all British Columbians to be measured in their purchase of groceries and other basic necessities. Our retail supply-chain providers have assured us they have an abundance of supply and are restocking regularly. There is no need to stockpile.

“If you have questions about self-isolating, caring for yourself and your family, and whether you may require a test, the BCCDC website continues to be an important first point for the latest information: http://bccdc.ca”

837,2020-03-13,,Canada,British Columbia,,"Announce 11 new cases, total 64 in BC",General case announcement,General,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0081-000493,BC Ministry of Health,,Government Website,Joint statement on update on new and existing COVID-19 cases in B.C.,"Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:

“We are announcing 11 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 64 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are all in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) testing.

“Three cases are connected to a cluster at Lions Gate Hospital, one is a close contact of the previously identified worker at the Lynn Valley Care Centre, five cases are travel-related and the remaining two cases are under investigation.

“The three individuals at Lions Gate Hospital are administrative staff. They have no known link to the Lynn Valley Care Centre, nor do they have regular contact with patients.

“Of those cases linked to travel, patients include two from Egypt, one from Iran, one from the Philippines and one from Mexico.

“Public health teams continue to be on site at both the Lynn Valley Care Centre and the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence, working to contain potential transmission to other residents and workers.

“From the outset, we have been proactive in our efforts. Our approach has been to get ahead of increasing risks and do all we can to break the chain of transmission, and we will continue to do so.

“We recently provided direction and recommendations on travel and public gatherings, and we would like to thank all British Columbians for doing their part in supporting these efforts.

“We are recommending against all non-essential travel outside of Canada. Should you choose to travel, stay away from work or school for 14 days on your return. Guidance for self-isolation is available on the BCCDC website: http://bccdc.ca

“For those who must continue to cross our borders for essential travel, to facilitate the movement of goods and people, we recommend social distancing, active daily monitoring for symptoms and staying away from people who are most vulnerable while abroad and on your return.

“In directing event organizers to cancel all gatherings larger than 250, our objective is to enable everyone to maintain important social distancing measures, which is much more challenging in larger events. It also means you can still do your shopping, go to restaurants, attend family events and continue to enjoy many other activities.

“The recommendations and direction are about protecting our community and about slowing down the transmission of COVID-19 to enable our health-care system to continue to support those who need care – whether with COVID-19 or another illness.

“We continue widespread testing of those with symptoms to identify cases of COVID-19 and take immediate action. As of March 13, 2020, 6,326 individuals have been tested in B.C. We commend health-care workers across our province and at the BCCDC for their incredible work in this area.

“We continue to activate the British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Coordination Plan. One example of the measures we are taking is to enable emergency, temporary registration of physicians and nurses. That is now in place and we have already received many calls from across the province of offers to support our pandemic response.

“Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes, providing support to over 10,000 callers in the last three days. We are adding more staff and more phone lines to resolve the intermittent busy signals some people have experienced.”

“Three cases are connected to the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence, three cases are travel-related and one is a community case.

“The three individuals are connected to the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence in West Vancouver include case 48, a male in his 40s and case 49, a female in her 40s, both of whom are health-care workers at Hollyburn. Case 47 is a man in his 90s, a resident. Public health teams are on site and actively working to investigate and contain potential transmission to other residents and workers. The outbreak at this facility is linked to the outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre.

“Case 50 is a man in his 40s who returned from travel in the United Kingdom and lives in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.

“Case 51 is a man in his 40s. Case 52 is a woman in her 40s. Both cases 51 and 52 live in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and are returning from a group trip to Egypt.

“Case 53 is a man in his 50s and is a community case identified through laboratory surveillance. He is self-isolating at his home in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.

Of B.C.’s 53 COVID-19 cases, four people have fully recovered and one woman in her 60s remains in in hospital in the Fraser Health region in stable condition. All other individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 are in isolation at home with care and support from public health teams.

“With the increasing transmission of COVID-19 at mass gatherings and events, in addition to the escalating risk of community transmission, we must do our best to slow transmission of COVID-19 and protect our communities.

“Our schools and our workplaces are operating safely, and we want to keep it that way.

“We are recommending against all non-essential travel outside of Canada, including to the United States. Effective today, anyone who chooses to travel outside of Canada will be asked to stay away from work or school for 14 days upon their return. We know that this is a voluntary measure, but it is our expectation that people will follow this direction as part of their civic duty. 

“Effective today, we also directing all event organizers to cancel any gathering larger than 250 people. This includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious gatherings or other similar events. This threshold has been selected, as it is much easier to maintain important social distancing to prevent transmission of COVID-19.

“Some post-secondary institutions have classes with more than 250 students, and we are working with them to take measures to address this situation.

“Over spring break the B.C. government will also work with school districts to develop procedures to be implemented with students and staff when classes resume.

“We are asking employers to excuse staff for sick leave without requiring a doctor’s note, if their employees are ill or required to self-isolate. We are also reinforcing that if you have symptoms and may have been exposed to COVID-19, you must call your local primary care provider, or 811, to arrange for safe testing.

“We have heard reports of employers requiring all their staff to get tested. Only a health-care professional can determine whether you require a test – and employers should not require employees to have a test if a health-care provider has recommended against it.

“We recognize this will have a significant economic and social impact, and want to reassure British Columbians that these are temporary measures required to protect the health of the public at this critical time of pandemic. We will be reassessing these conditions on an ongoing basis as the pandemic evolves.

“Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes - providing support to 3,291 callers yesterday, March 11, 2020. We are adding more staff and more phone lines to resolve the intermittent busy signals some people have experienced.

“We are announcing seven new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 46 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal Health, Fraser Health and Island Health regions.

“Two cases are connected to the Lynn Valley Care Centre, three cases are travel-related and two are community cases.

“Case 40 is a male in 20s living in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and case 45 is a woman in her 50s living in the Fraser Health region. Both work at the Lynn Valley Care Centre. There are no new resident cases.

“Case 43 is a male in his 70s living in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Case 46 is a man in his 60s living in the Island Health region. Both cases 43 and 46 have returned from travelling in Egypt. 

“Case 42 is a man in his 70s from Egypt, who is visiting family in the Fraser Health region.

“Case 41 is a woman in her 60s, currently in hospital. Case 44 is a man in his 60s. Both are new community cases, who were identified through laboratory surveillance, and both reside in the Fraser Health region.

“Three patients have been discharged from hospital and are now recovering at home. One person is in hospital. All other patients with COVID-19 remain in isolation at home with care and support from public health teams.

“We have seen an increase in community cases in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley in recent days, where the source of the virus infection is not yet known. Public health teams are actively investigating, as we continue work to limit the spread of transmission in B.C.

“Today, we are asking British Columbians to take additional care of seniors and people with compromised immune systems. Do not visit them if you are sick. If they are living at home and are sick, consider how you may support them with food and other necessities. If you need to visit a long-term care home or other health-care facility, go one person at a time and limit your visit to the person you know.

“We are working with all long-term care and assisted living facilities to implement enhanced prevention measures to further protect all residents.

mitigate the impact of this illness on communities, the B.C. government 
and the provincial health officer have developed the British Columbia 
Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan to respond to the evolving 
outbreak.  Premier John Horgan has appointed a deputy ministers' committee
 to oversee a whole-of-government approach to implementing the plan, 
reporting directly to a new cabinet committee that he and Health 
Minister Adrian Dix will co-chair.“From the first day the world 
learned of this outbreak, B.C.’s public health officials have delivered 
the most robust response of any jurisdiction in this hemisphere. Through
 this co-ordination plan, we will ensure they have the support they need
 so we are prepared for all possibilities,” Premier Horgan said.B.C.’s
 COVID-19 pandemic response plans include a wide range of planning and 
preparedness actions to help individuals, local governments, 
health-sector organizations and businesses to plan for the possibility 
of a pandemic. The plan focuses on delaying, containing and preparing 
the province to minimize serious illness and economic disruption.“The
 COVID-19 situation continues to evolve here in B.C., Canada and other 
countries in the world. We are at a critical point in the fight against 
the virus and we will ensure B.C.’s health system and population are 
ready for any scenario,” Dix said. Phase 1 of the plan is 
underway, addressing identification and containment -- continuing strong
 public health testing and close collaboration with the federal 
government on border surveillance, to identify and isolate individuals 
who test positive for the virus and their close contacts. The priority 
is to delay the onset of widespread community transmission for as long 
as possible.Phase 2 would escalate cross-government co-ordination to quickly direct actions and resources, as required. It
 also prepares for the use of emergency powers set out in the Emergency 
Program Act and Public Health Act. It would ensure provincial business 
and service continuity – with four priorities:
Protecting PopulationProtecting Vulnerable CitizensProtecting Health WorkersSupporting Health-care Capacity

Protecting Population actions would include 
increasing testing capacity and expanding communication with at-risk 
groups. It would also enact government continuity plans to prepare for 
the possibility of high absence rates due to illness, or if employees 
are absent in order to care for family. It would also provide supports 
for businesses and institutions to manage the same challenges through a 
sustained three- to four-month outbreak; including grocery stores, 
public transportation, schools and the tourism sector.
Protecting Vulnerable Citizens actions would include
 ways to protect seniors in long-term care, assisted living and home and
 community care, which could include reducing the number of people 
coming into facilities, screening visitors and increasing testing for 
illness of residents and health-care workers.
Protecting Health Workers actions would include 
implementing standardized preparedness plans at the local level to 
support health-care workers to respond to a wider outbreak and 
provincially manage and co-ordinate supply chains for hospital, 
community and primary care. It would also bring in additional 
health-care capacity for specific communities under stress by 
establishing a list of health-care workers who could be rapidly 
redeployed for a sustained period. 
Supporting Health-Care Capacity actions would use established emergency operation committees across health authorities to assess the ability to plan and respond at a local level to a community-wide outbreak and create capacity, as needed, in hospitals for:
discharging low-risk patients;deferring scheduled surgeries and procedures;identifying capacity for new care spaces within hospitals; andensuring bed equipment capacity.It would also ensure readiness to implement hospital-wide 
protocols to safely triage and separate anyone presenting with 
respiratory illness. “The COVID-19 pandemic response plans and 
materials are developed in partnership with our experts at the BC Centre
 for Disease Control, based on our provincial influenza pandemic plans 
that all health authorities had implemented in 2012, as well as the 
lessons we had learned from H1N1 and SARS in the past,” said Dr. Bonnie 
Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. “Thanks to the great efforts 
made by our public health leaders and health-care workers, we have kept 
the risk of COVID-19 spread low in B.C., but it is important for people,
 communities and organizations to build resiliency and have plans in 
place, not just for the possibility of a pandemic but emergency in 
general.”Of British Columbia’s 21 confirmed COVID-19 cases, four 
B.C. patients have now fully recovered. With the exception of one 
patient who is in the intensive care unit at Vancouver General Hospital,
 all other individuals with COVID-19 are in isolation at home with 
support and monitoring from public health teams.As of Friday, March 6, 2020, the BC Centre for Disease control has tested 2,803 samples for 2,008 people.",

“The most important measures people can take today are to proactively prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.

“We ask all British Columbians to stay home and away from others if you or your family are sick. We recommend cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve and disposing of tissues appropriately. To further contain transmission, we also recommend suspending usual greetings such as handshakes, hugs and kisses.

“For you and your family, similar to how you may need to care for someone with influenza, you want to ensure you have sufficient food, medications and support in place to stay home for a number of days. These are normal preparations when someone in your family is ill – there is no requirement for British Columbians to stockpile supplies.

“For employers, we recommend increasing cleaning and hand hygiene availability, in addition to thinking about how to manage absenteeism through steps such as remote working or virtual meetings.

“Schools should be increasing cleaning and hand hygiene, educating students on respiratory etiquette, in addition to putting mechanisms in place to support students who may be away for extended periods.

“Gathering large numbers of people together can increase the risk of transmission. Event organizers should ask all participants to stay away if they are sick, returning from affected areas or have underlying health conditions that may be impacted by respiratory illness. Organizers should also complete a risk assessment considering what is happening in the local community and who may attend the event. Local public health teams can assist with this assessment.

“Vancouver Coastal Health is actively investigating. Close contacts have been identified and contacted by public health officials. Those who may be at risk are now in isolation for 14 days and are being actively monitored for symptoms.

“We are pleased to report that three additional patients who previously tested positive for COVID-19 are now fully recovered, for a total of four fully recovered patients. The other individuals continue to recover in isolation at home and under the care of public health teams. The BCCDC has completed testing on 1,425 samples for 1012 individuals as of Feb. 27, 2020.

“While the risk of spread of COVID-19 within British Columbia remains low at this time, we continue to focus efforts on containing and delaying the spread of transmission, as well as preparing for the possibility of a pandemic. A pandemic is the spread of an illness to a large number of people on a global scale.

“We are asking all British Columbians to do their part to prevent the transmission of infections in our communities and in our health-care system to help protect everyone in B.C.

“Similar to how you may need to care for someone with influenza, you want to ensure you have sufficient food, medications and support in place to stay home for a number for days.

“Employers should increase cleaning and hand hygiene availability, in addition to thinking about how they will manage absenteeism through steps such as remote working or virtual meetings.

“The most important measures people can take today is to proactively prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. This includes cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve and disposing of tissues appropriately. It is also very important to stay home and away from others if you or your family are sick.

“British Columbians with upcoming travel plans should continue to monitor the Government of Canada travel site for the latest travel advisories: https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/210

“Travellers should understand that as global efforts to contain COVID-19 continue, the availability of health-care services in some areas may be limited and travel restrictions may be put in place suddenly.

“We ask all international travellers who are returning to B.C. to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms. If any symptoms arise, limit their contact with others and connect with their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811 to determine if COVID-19 testing is needed. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.”

If any symptoms arise, limit their contact with others and contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.

“People who have recently travelled through the Hubei province of China or are returning from quarantined cruise ships are being contacted by public health officials and are self-isolating for 14 days upon arriving in B.C. after leaving the area of potential exposure.

Punjabi translation available","Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in British Columbia:

“We are announcing a second presumptive positive case of novel coronavirus in B.C.

“The second person who tested positive is a woman in her 50s who resides in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Laboratory testing results returned positive from the BC Centre for Disease Control late Monday, Feb. 3, and samples have been sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation. Vancouver Coastal Health is undertaking a detailed case investigation and will follow up with each of her close contacts. The individual had close contact with family visitors from Wuhan city and is in isolation at home.

“Our knowledge of 2019-nCoV continues to grow as new information becomes available. Across the country, federal, provincial and territorial governments are using this new evidence to inform and adjust our public health actions as circumstances develop globally.

“As the federal government works to bring returning Canadians home from Wuhan, the decision was made to quarantine passengers from the special charter flight for 14 days. These individuals are returning from the most intensely affected areas of China, and they will receive psychosocial and medical support upon their return, as well as consular services.

“We are working closely with public health officials across Canada. Our focus is on people in British Columbia. Given the changing dynamics of the outbreak in China and globally, and recognizing we are in the midst of influenza season, we ask anyone here in B.C. who has been in Hubei province to consider staying home and keeping their children home until 14 days have passed from their last visit to Hubei. Monitor yourself and your children closely for symptoms, and if any symptoms arise, connect with your primary care provider, local public health office or call 811. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.

“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are watching the evolution of the outbreak in China very closely and will notify the public if the measures we need to take in B.C. change.

“The most important measures to prevent all respiratory illnesses including this novel coronavirus remain cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you become sick.

“The federal government announced its plans to bring Canadians home from Hubei, China. In the near future, a repatriation flight will bring Canadians from Hubei province, including Wuhan city, to Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Trenton near Toronto. Each of these returning Canadians, including staff and flight crew, will remain at CFB Trenton for 14 days to receive the necessary social and medical support they may need.

“We have been working closely with the federal government to ensure the repatriation process is smooth and conducted in a way that best protects the returning Canadians and the public here at home. It is expected that B.C. will be the final destination for some of the returning Canadians, and we will continue liaising with the federal government as it identifies passengers for the repatriation flight.

“The returning Canadians will spend 14 days at CFB Trenton, which is the 2019 novel coronavirus maximum incubation period, so they can be assessed and monitored, and to support their transition back to Canada.

“In B.C., we have chosen testing criteria with an intentionally low threshold to purposely ensure a wide range of people are eligible for novel coronavirus testing. On Friday, Jan. 31, we reported testing 114 samples and one confirmed case. Updates will be published each Friday at: www.bccdc.ca

“There continues to be one confirmed case in B.C.

“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are watching the evolution of the outbreak in China very closely and will notify the public if the measures we need to take in B.C. change.

“All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. We have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond in order to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in the province.

“The most important measures to prevent all respiratory illnesses, including this novel coronavirus, remain cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you become sick.

“Late yesterday, our BC Centre for Disease Control public health lab confirmed a positive test for 2019-nCoV.

“The person is a male in his forties and a resident in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. He travels regularly to China for work and was in Wuhan city on his most recent trip. He returned to Vancouver last week and had an onset of symptoms after his return.

“On Sunday, Jan. 26, he followed public health messaging, contacted a primary health-care provider to notify them that he had travelled to Wuhan city, was experiencing symptoms and would be coming for assessment and care.

“Following established protocols, the primary-care provider notified the Vancouver Coastal Health medical health officer and administered the diagnostic test.

“Late last night, the test came back positive.

“Public health officials are in regular contact with the individual and a small number of close contacts. He is in isolation at home.

“The risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia remains low at this time. All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. We have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond, in order to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in the province.

“The BC Centre for Disease Control has a team of experts that support the Province’s operations in monitoring and controlling communicable and vaccine-preventable diseases.

“The PHO is responsible for monitoring and assessing the health status of the population, making recommendations for strategies to address health issues and implementing immediate actions when necessary to protect the health of the public. The PHO has directed health-care workers to be vigilant and to take a travel history for anyone reporting respiratory symptoms.

“It is not necessary for the general public to take special precautions beyond the usual measures recommended to prevent other common respiratory viruses during the winter period. Regular handwashing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and avoiding contact with sick people are important ways to prevent the spread of respiratory illness generally.

“The BC Centre for Disease Control and provincial and federal authorities are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness linked to a novel coronavirus.

“The risk to British Columbians is considered low. Most cases have been reported in Wuhan and other cities in China. But cases have also been reported outside of China, including Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand. Today, the United States Centre for Disease Control confirmed a case was detected in a Washington State resident who recently returned from travel to Wuhan.

“To date, there have been no cases of illness caused by the coronavirus in British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada.

“We are watching the situation closely and health-care workers have been asked to be vigilant and take a travel history for anyone reporting respiratory symptoms.

“In co-ordination with the Public Health Agency of Canada, our public health teams are responding by closely monitoring the situation and have implemented screening for early detection of infections for individuals arriving in airports. Quarantine officers are available at Vancouver International Airport to co-ordinate any response required, and Richmond Hospital infection control practitioners are ready to respond to any potential scenario where a patient may require further investigation.

“The BC Centre for Disease Control has also developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus, which is different from the SARS outbreak when there was no similar test. The centre is co-ordinating staff and supplies to ensure they are prepared to quickly and accurately detect potential cases.

“The provincial health officer has also shared awareness notifications to infection control practitioners, emergency department staff and primary care providers reminding them to screen for coronavirus symptoms and exposure. Providers who suspect an instance of coronavirus are asked to report it to their local medical health officers immediately.

“Canada's Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health is meeting regularly with the Public Health Agency of Canada, which is co-ordinating with the World Health Organization. Future actions to prevent the spread of this coronavirus will continue to be co-ordinated with these organizations.

“The four remaining B.C. patients with COVID-19 are recovering in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public-health teams. The fifth case identified on Friday, Feb. 14, 2020, was confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory on Saturday, Feb. 15.

Fourteen days is believed to be the longest incubation period for COVID-19.

“Public-health teams in B.C. have connected with other returning travellers to assess and monitor them for symptoms. At this time, Westerdam travellers require 14 days of self-isolation at home.

“Public-health teams continue to be active in the community, supporting those who have self-isolated, or may be concerned about symptoms to ensure they are being assessed, tested and cared for. These teams also undertake the important tasks of monitoring the four confirmed cases and providing daily symptom checks for close contacts who are self-isolating.

“In addition, public-health teams actively investigate the travel history of confirmed cases and contact people at risk of exposure to ensure they are isolated, if needed, and monitored for symptoms.

This includes travel to Alaska.

Individuals who have travelled outside of Yukon in the last 14 days, or who are feeling sick, are banned from visiting hospitals.

Long-term care facilities are closed to visitors and volunteers, unless family members are at the end of life or gravely ill regardless of travel.  

These restrictions are accompanied by several others including the following:

Mass gatherings of more than 50 people are banned, including at houses of worship.
Parents or caregivers who are able to keep their children home from spring break daycamps, or daycare, are requested to do so. Fewer children in camps or daycares will help to limit any spread.
People who can work from home are requested to do so. Employers are asked to look for ways to support employees to work from home where possible.
Many of us are interested in how COVID-19 is spread from one person to another.  As an emerging disease, there are many uncertainties about its characteristics.  The information that we communicate today is the best knowledge at this time.  This knowledge does change and get out of date rapidly, and we are keeping updated and adjusting our response accordingly. We must all be cautious and patient as the information changes.

Current evidence supports that the main route of COVID-19 spread is from person-to-person through respiratory droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs. The risk of transmission is believed to be highest when the person is most symptomatic. However recent evidence and modelling suggests that transmission may occur prior to symptoms being present.  Major uncertainties remain in the role that asymptomatic transmission may play in the spread of COVID-19.

At this time in Yukon, we are recommending self-isolation for all travellers from international destinations, even those without symptoms.  This precautionary measure is important as we are working with an illness that is not fully understood. 

All people returning from international travel should self-isolate for 14 days.  This means that they should stay home or in the outdoors where they can be 2 metres away from other people. See the Government of Canada webpage for more information.

We are asking all people throughout Yukon to do their part to keep Yukon healthy.  Please continue to practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. Please be especially considerate of people over 65 years old and people who have underlying medical conditions who are at highest risk of severe complications of respiratory infections including influenza and COVID-19.

Persons who are returning from travel outside Canada and have any cough or sensation of fever, even mild, should consider themselves infectious and be extra cautious with their self-isolation and distancing from those at highest risk of severe infection.  In that case please self-isolate and call YCDC at 867-667-8323 or 1-800-661-0408 ext. 8323.

The situation with COVID-19 is fluid and we continue to update our guidance based on the latest information.  We will continue to provide the public regular updates as the situation continues to evolve.

Yours in health,

Current evidence supports that the main route of COVID-19 spread is from person-to-person through respiratory droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs. The risk of transmission is believed to be highest when the person is most symptomatic. However recent evidence and modelling suggests that transmission may occur prior to symptoms being present.  Major uncertainties remain in the role that asymptomatic transmission may play in the spread of COVID-19.

At this time in Yukon, we are recommending self-isolation for all travellers from international destinations, even those without symptoms.  This precautionary measure is important as we are working with an illness that is not fully understood. 

All people returning from international travel should self-isolate for 14 days.  This means that they should stay home or in the outdoors where they can be 2 metres away from other people. See the Government of Canada webpage for more information.

We are asking all people throughout Yukon to do their part to keep Yukon healthy.  Please continue to practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. Please be especially considerate of people over 65 years old and people who have underlying medical conditions who are at highest risk of severe complications of respiratory infections including influenza and COVID-19.

Persons who are returning from travel outside Canada and have any cough or sensation of fever, even mild, should consider themselves infectious and be extra cautious with their self-isolation and distancing from those at highest risk of severe infection.  In that case please self-isolate and call YCDC at 867-667-8323 or 1-800-661-0408 ext. 8323.

The situation with COVID-19 is fluid and we continue to update our guidance based on the latest information.  We will continue to provide the public regular updates as the situation continues to evolve.

","The Yukon government announced a series of measures on Monday to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts.

Health officials said Monday there are still no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 in the territory, and urged people to self-isolate as much as possible to slow any spread of the coronavirus.

Premier Sandy Silver announced a $4-million ""support package"" to deal with some of the economic fallout. It will be used for, among other things, compensation for workers who need to stay home but don't get paid sick days.

""This will make money available to support workers for up to 10 working days enough to cover a 14-day isolation period if needed,"" Silver said at a news conference Monday.

The fund will also be used for waiving and refunding some government fees, deferring workers' compensation premiums and reimbursing pre-paid premiums, and offering grants to businesses that have lost revenue from cancelled events.

""We know that local businesses need to persevere through this situation. We need workers to have jobs to return to when COVID-19 runs its course,"" Silver said.


""We need tourism operators to welcome visitors when it's safe to travel again, we need Yukoners to feel able to self-isolate if needed and we need people to practice social distancing.

""I am confident that we can keep Yukoners working. Yukon is a very strong community ... I know that Yukon will come through this difficult time even stronger than we were before.""

'Critical moment is now'
Silver acknowledged that COVID-19 will make its way to Yukon at some point, and health officials suggested the same. 

At an earlier news conference on Monday, they called for ""concerted massive action"" to minimize the impact.

""The critical moment is now,"" said Dr. Catherine Elliott, Yukon's deputy chief medical officer of health, at an earlier news conference on Monday, where officials announced a series of measures to slow any spread of the coronavirus.


'The weapon that we have is the public response,' said Yukon's Chief Medical Officer of Health Brendan Hanley at a news briefing on Monday with Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health Catherine Elliott. (Dave Croft/CBC)
""The goal is to decrease how quickly COVID-19 spreads from person to person ... and we also are working to delay the introduction into Yukon.""

Among the measures urged by Elliott and Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley:

a ban on any gathering of 50 people or more
no visitors, including volunteers, to long-term care facilities except when family members are at end-of-life
no visits to health care facilities if you've been outside Canada in last 14 days 
work from home if possible
keep children home from daycare or camp if possible
seniors and people with underlying medical conditions avoid social gatherings
physicians rely more on virtual care and telehealth where possible
Officials are not calling for bars and restaurants to close, but urged those businesses to keep capacity low enough inside to allow people to be well spaced. 

Hanley called the recommendations a ""measured response,"" and said more protective measures may be introduced as the situation changes.

""These are the measures that we need for today, let's see what we need for tomorrow,"" he said.

Hanley said Yukoners should take things very serious, and that ""it's now or never"" for people to work together as a community to keep each other safe. That means social distancing and self-isolating as much as possible.

""The weapon that we have is the public response,"" he said.

""We have a gift right now and that gift is we're a little bit ahead of the game, and we're trying to stay that way.""",

Child care programs
Day cares and child care centres do not need to close. Child care programs are considered to be an essential service that should remain in place as long as possible. They provide access to social supports particularly for vulnerable children and families and for parents who are themselves providing essential services to help keep Yukoners safe. Daycare operators have been briefed on safe social distancing measures within a daycare environment.

811 changes coming
In the coming day or so, people calling 811 for COVID-19 advice will have two options:

they will be able speak to the Public Health Agency of Canada; or
if they have COVID-19 symptoms and have travelled internationally within the last 14 days, or if they have symptoms and have come in contact with an individual with a confirmed case of COVID-19, they can speak to staff at Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC).

The symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough or shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing.

People can also still call 811 for non-COVID-19 health advice in the usual way.

Self-assessment tool
Yukoners are reminded that they can now access an online self-assessment tool on Yukon.ca/novel-coronavirus if they have concerns about COVID-19.

This third case is related to travel outside of Yukon. The individual was tested on Monday, March 23 and test results were received this morning. The individual is doing well at home and contact tracing has begun.

Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many test have been negative, how many results are pending and the total number of tests.

Services for hospital outpatients
Yukon hospitals are suspending all non-urgent or routine services from Thursday, March 26. This includes bloodwork and lab tests, x-rays, CT scans and other imaging services, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, and specialist appointments.

Yukoners should not go to a hospital for a non-urgent service, treatment or exam at this time. The hospitals continue to provide urgent emergency care.

These measures are being taken to help the hospitals make sure they have enough staff and resources to respond to the pandemic and ensure only those who need to be in hospital are in a hospital. These steps also support their efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 – and practice physical distancing from each other.

Health care insurance
The Government of Yukon is extending the Health Care Insurance Plan to cover Yukon residents who are not able to return to the territory because of the pandemic. The usual requirement to be resident in Yukon for at least 180 days to qualify for health care insurance will be waived.

Respiratory assessment centre
The respiratory assessment centre in Whitehorse is now open to support people with acute respiratory illness such as influenza or COVID-19 who need medical assessment. Yukoners will be referred to the centre from 811, a family physician’s office, Yukon Communicable Disease Control or a hospital emergency department.

Self-isolation
Yukoners and any visitors are reminded they must self-isolate for 14 days as soon as they arrive in Yukon if they have travelled within Canada or internationally. People must not stop to get groceries or make visits but go straight home and then arrange the support they need.

Yukoners should also self-isolate if they have been identified as a close contact of someone diagnosed with COVID-19.

Self-isolation means staying at home for 14 days, monitoring for symptoms and avoiding close contact with other people when going outside for fresh air. The term “quarantine” is not used in Yukon, as it is used by the Public Health Agency of Canada to mean a mandatory restriction of movement in a location determined by that agency.

The program is in line with the recommendation from the recently established Business Advisory Council.

The Government of Yukon is working with industry organizations and the local business community to support Yukon businesses and workers impacted by COVID-19. The Government of Yukon continues to work with the Government of Canada to assess economic impacts and support our economy.

This program is the latest Government of Yukon initiative to support Yukon’s business sector and is anticipated to cost up to $10 million.

Whitehorse General Hospital continues to prepare for the pandemic. They are planning now on how to potentially accommodate a high volume of COVID-19 patients, including identifying other facilities where care could be provided. They are also putting physical distancing measures in place and planning for the effective management of resources such as staff, equipment and supplies.

Contact tracing
People who test positive for COVID-19 may have a history of a flight or flights within the preceding 14 days. In such cases, the Government of Yukon will use information from the airline, when available, to contact only the people on that flight who were sitting specifically within the range of the infected individual.

People identified within that range are directly contacted and required to monitor themselves for symptoms. If they develop symptoms they must immediately self-isolate and contact Yukon Communicable Disease Control. This is a precautionary approach to account for any possible transmission on flights and avoids the publication of flight information. When flight manifest information is not available, the public posting of flight information may be required.

Safe spacing
Keeping two metres apart from other people is one of the most effective ways to help stop the spread of COVID-19. This behaviour has been referred to as “social distancing” but this language is shifting to the phrases “physical distancing” and “safe spacing” as that wording is clearer and easier for people to visualize and act on.

Yukoners are reminded that other powerful ways to help stop the spread of COVID-19 are frequent handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding face touching.

Host a Virtual Easter Gathering

With the holiday long weekend approaching, be prepared to celebrate Easter in a different way this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Instead of inviting family and friends over for dinner, host a virtual gathering using digital technology.

Here are some other things to keep in mind:

Restrict in-person Easter gatherings to only people living in the same home.
Beat the pre-holiday rush and purchase your Easter dinner groceries ahead of time.  Remember, only one person from a household should go shopping.  Make a list so you can quickly purchase your goods.
Always practice preventative measures – frequent hand washing and physical distancing.

Prevent Transmission in Essential Workplaces

While all residents should stay home if they can, there are many essential workplaces throughout the province, including healthcare and industrial settings, grocery stores and supported and group living homes.

There continues to be a risk of local transmission in these essential workplaces and all employers and employees are reminded to practice prevention methods at all times – on the job site, in the breakroom or when working outdoors.

• Actively monitor for symptoms.  At the first sign of cough, immediately self-isolate for 14 days.
• Practice physical distancing in the workplace, including those workplaces that are outdoors.  Maintain a two-metre separation between individuals.
• Wash your hands often.
• Cough/sneeze into your elbow or tissue and wash your hands immediately.

Workplaces must ensure their occupational health and safety guidelines are up to date and being enforced to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses.

Further information is available online at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID-19 under the Information for Businesses and Workers section.

Be Efficient When Shopping

While many grocery stores and retailers have taken steps to reduce crowding, you also need to do your part.  If possible, only one person from a household should go shopping for essentials – no more than once per week.  Make a list ahead of time so you can shop in an efficient manner instead of browsing.

“With the risk of COVID-19 within the province, we are encouraging everyone to download the SaskAlert App,” SPSA President Marlo Pritchard said.  “The app will provide urgent, critical information about how individuals and families can protect themselves.”

The SaskAlert App allows users to choose to receive emergency public alerts for the entire province, a particular municipality or a First Nation community.  The app can target residents in a geographic area if urgent information is specific to one region or municipality within the province.

In case of an emergency, a tone will sound, similar to receiving a normal text message notification – even when the app is closed.  Individuals can then open the app to find information on the emergency and instructions on any actions you are required to take.

“Using the SaskAlert App to push out emergency notifications is not meant to replace the normal methods of getting your news,” Pritchard said.  “However, it is an effective method of pushing out urgent information province-wide, or to a localized area.”

The app is available for download on Android and Apple devices at http://emergencyalert.saskatchewan.ca/.

COVID-19 and pets

There is no evidence to date that domestic livestock and pets can be infected with or transmit COVID-19 but infection and transmission by animals has also not been ruled out.  Therefore, anyone who has COVID-19 should avoid contact with animals, just as they should with people, until more information is available.  If there is already an animal in the household, that animal should remain in isolation along with the patient.

Assisted Living Worker Tests Positive for COVID-19

An employee at an Eden Care assisted living facility in Regina has tested positive for COVID-19.  There are no indications it has spread to other employees or residents.  The facility is closed to admissions, discharges and transfers, and residents who have been in close contact with the employee will be isolated and monitored twice daily for 14 days.

The facility, with support from the Saskatchewan Health Authority, is taking action, including visitor restrictions, to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. 

Staff Assessments at Long-Term Care Facilities

Effective today, all employees working at long-term care facilities in Saskatchewan will have their temperatures checked and will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms prior to beginning their shifts.

Regulatory Measures in Place to License Additional Professionals

Retired employees now have an easier and quicker way to help provide urgent patient care.  The Ministry of Health has been working with professional health bodies to put measures in place to provide temporary licenses for retired, non-practising and student members.  The Government of Saskatchewan is covering the fees for these professionals, which can cost several hundred dollars per member per year depending on the regulatory body.

Small Group Gatherings

Under the current public health order, all private and public gatherings – inside and outside – are limited to a maximum of 10 people.  As a general rule, however, you should not have anyone visit your home at this time who does not live at your residence.

Instead, connect with friends and family safely via video, phone or social media as much as possible to maintain your social connections and mental health.  If it’s essential to have a small gathering of no more than 10 people, everyone at the gathering must be able to maintain the required two-metre distance between them.

Handing things back and forth is a common route of transmission in social settings.  Even when doing outdoor activities like riding a bike or going for a walk, do not hand items back and forth between people not from the same household.

The response will support vulnerable Saskatchewan citizens and the organizations that serve them by leveraging existing resources within the system, adapting policies and allocating new resources.

“Our government is committed to providing supports to vulnerable citizens in Saskatchewan through this time of uncertainty,” Social Services Minister Paul Merriman said.  “The Social Services Pandemic Response provides additional funding to emergency shelters across the province while leveraging existing resources, including vacant social housing units, to ensure each client has the support they require.”

The Social Services Pandemic Response includes measures to provide additional funding to emergency shelters, modifies service delivery models to accommodate capacity pressures due to physical distancing and the need for clients to self-isolate.  The response also includes measures to ease the burden on existing clients as they work with the Ministry of Social Services.

Pandemic Emergency Shelter Support

Government is announcing one-time additional funding of $171,000 targeted at meeting extra cost pressure emergency shelters are experiencing as they continue to serve those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This brings funding for emergency shelters to a total of $3.93 million.

Organizations receiving the increase are: Lloydminster Men’s Shelter; YWCA Regina - My Aunt’s Place; YWCA Prince Albert; YWCA Saskatoon; Lighthouse Saskatoon; Lighthouse North Battleford; Salvation Army Saskatoon; Salvation Army Regina; Soul’s Harbour Regina and Soul’s Harbour Moose Jaw.  These organizations currently provide more than 300 beds for individuals who need emergency shelter and supports.

Modified Service Delivery Model

The Emergency Shelter Response also includes a modified delivery model adapting the Cold Weather Strategy to respond to pressures created by COVID-19.

When emergency shelters are unable to meet the needs of an individual or family because of capacity pressures, Social Services will support those in need with funds for emergency hotel stays and will work to transition clients to permanent housing.

If a client is required by Public Health to self-isolate due to COVID-19 symptoms or exposure, that person will be transitioned to a safe accommodation such as a hotel or an individual housing unit.

There are approximately 1,700 vacant Saskatchewan Housing Corporation units located in 29 larger communities that will be leveraged to ensure those impacted by COVID-19 are able to access housing or an individualized space to self isolate.  An additional 1,200 units are available in smaller communities across Saskatchewan.

Social Services will continue to work with Saskatchewan’s network of emergency shelter providers to ensure those who are homeless and lack the means to pay for their basic needs are served.  After hours, referrals for emergency hotel stays are also made on behalf of the ministry by Mobile Crisis Services and the Salvation Army.

Individuals who have, or are suspected of having, COVID-19 and lack money to meet their basic needs should apply for any Federal Benefits they would be eligible for.  Those needing immediate emergency help, such as food or shelter, can contact the local service centre, their worker or the Client Service Centre at 1-866-221-5200.

Support for Children, Youth and Families

Social Services is acting on the request from the Saskatchewan Youth in Care and Custody Network to delay transitions to independence for young people.  This mean that any youth that “ages out of care” during the COVID-19 pandemic will not be transitioned out of their current housing.  Case workers are contacting impacted youth and their caregivers to ensure that supports and services continue.

To help families receiving the Child Care Subsidy (CCS), any families who were receiving part-time benefits because their children were attending school will receive full-time benefits, retroactive to March 1, 2020.  The CCS helps parents with low to moderate incomes with the costs of licensed child care.

New Saskatchewan Housing Benefit

The Saskatchewan Housing Corporation will begin accepting applications for the new Saskatchewan Housing Benefit (SHB) on April 1, 2020.  The SHB is a federal-provincial program delivered through the National Housing Strategy.  It aligns with the strategy’s principles of people, communities, and partnerships.  It also aligns with the province’s focus on helping people in greatest housing need.

SHB is a monthly benefit available to eligible households, including seniors, families, couples and singles.  It will be available to Saskatchewan renters who:

rent from a community housing provider, such as a non-profit housing provider or co-operative;
pay more than 50 per cent of household income on rent and utilities;
have incomes and assets below the program limits; and
are not receiving another government benefit to help with their housing/shelter costs.
Clients will receive a benefit based on their household composition:

Eligible households that require one bedroom, such as single individuals or couples, will receive $150 per month.
Households that require two bedrooms will receive $200 per month.
Households that require three or more bedrooms will receive $250 per month.
Application forms and additional information will be available on the Saskatchewan Housing Corporation website or by calling toll-free 1-844-787-4177.

Other actions under the Social Services Pandemic Response include the following actions that are being taken to ease the burden on existing clients during the COVID-19 pandemic:

Child and Family Programs (CFP)

Frontline child protection workers will have access to Personal Protective Equipment, safe work guidelines and training to protect themselves and the children and families they work with.

Whenever possible, child and family services and supports will be provided using alternate methods that avoid direct contact.  Staff who may need to enter homes to carry out their mandated work related to child safety have been provided with a series of screening questions to determine potential risk.
Income Assistance (IA)

All IA clients continue to receive their benefits.  Effective March 19, 2020, the ministry lessened reporting requirements across all of its programs.  If a client is late reporting, IA will still process their payment.

Social Services Physical Distancing and Eased Reporting Measures

Social Services offices remain open.  The first hour of the day is reserved for more vulnerable individuals, including those with a disability or health problem such as a compromised immune system.

To minimize in-person contact for the safety and well-being of clients and staff, clients are asked not come into the offices unless it is an emergency and they are unable to call their worker, or they are asked to come in.

People who would like to apply for assistance can do so online at www.saskatchewan.ca/income-support or call the Client Service Centre at 1-866-221-5200.  More staff have been shifted to the Call Centre to help serve those in need.

To ease the administrative burden on third party service providers and community-based organizations, Social Services will temporarily suspend financial reporting requirements.

Need to Remain Vigilant

Today’s number of new cases may be the lowest in a week, but it’s important not to get complacent with precautions for COVID-19.  It’s as important as ever to stay home whenever possible, and to avoid close contact (a minimum of two metres) with others to prevent spreading the virus.

People who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, travellers returning from international destinations, including the United States, and those who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 are required to self isolate under the current public health order.

There are reports of people across the province disregarding these directives, which will only increase the amount of time it takes to flatten the curve.  Do your part to help protect yourself, your neighbours and your community.

How to Protect Yourself and Others

 Practice proper cough and sneezing etiquette (into the bend of your elbow);
Wash your hands often with soap and water;
If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands;
Maintain safe food practices;
Avoid close contact with people who are sick;

","On Sunday, March 29, two Saskatchewan residents located in separate parts of the province died in hospital as a result of complications related to the COVID-19 virus.  The two fatalities represent the first deaths in Saskatchewan tied to the COVID-19 pandemic.

One was related to travel.  Both people were in their 70s.

As of March 30, 2020, the province of Saskatchewan has 20 new, confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing the provincial total to 176.

Five people are in hospital across the province, including four in acute care and one in the intensive care unit (ICU):

One inpatient case is located in the north, and three in Saskatoon.
One ICU case is located in Regina.
At least eight cases are a result of local transmission.  The rest are travel-related or cluster-related due to exposure at mass gatherings.
Five cases concern individuals 19 years of age and under; all other cases are adults.
80 cases are in the 20-44 age range; 62 are in the 45-64 range; and 29 are in the 65-plus range.
55 per cent of the cases are males and 45 per cent are females.
Six more people have recovered from the virus, bringing the provincial total to 14.
There may be more cases yet to be reported to Public Health.

To date, 9,651 COVID-19 tests have been performed in Saskatchewan, an increase of 565 from yesterday’s update.

The province continues to be a national leader in testing, with an aggressive strategy aimed at identifying and preventing the spread of the virus as quickly and effectively as possible.  Case surveillance and testing information, including regional locations of confirmed/presumptive cases is available at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

Government Redeploying Staff to Focus on Priorities

The Government of Saskatchewan is taking steps to identify key skill sets in all ministries in an effort to deploy additional staff to critical function areas.  Supplemental resources are required to handle contact tracing needs, staff call centres and public inquiries.  The province will continue to allocate as many resources as possible to address the COVID-19 challenge.

The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) already has up to 150 people involved in contact tracing.  Over the coming days, 50 additional staff from across government will be moved into this key role.  The need for additional resources will be assessed as the situation evolves.

Multiple Testing Sites Open Across the Province

As of March 30, there are more than 40 communities in Saskatchewan where COVID-19 testing is available.  Testing locations will continue to be expanded as demand warrants.  The current list of communities where testing is available can be found on www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19 under Testing Information.  Testing is by referrals only.

Case Increase Connected to Rally

A higher number of cases from the north and central regions is largely attributable to a Christopher Lake snowmobile rally dinner held on Saturday, March 14.  One attendee tested positive on March 25, and work to contact others at the dinner is now under way.

To date, 18 additional cases have been linked to this event.  Each person is self-isolating at home.  The outcome of this event demonstrates the importance of physical distancing at this time.  Everyone who attended this event – or any large gathering over the past several weeks – should be self-monitoring or self-isolating if directed by local public health authorities.

If you are experiencing any symptoms (fever, cough, sneezing, breathing issues, etc.), please use the online self-assessment tool at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19 and call 811.

Virtual Assessments Having an Impact

More than 25,000 telephone assessments were conducted by Saskatchewan physicians in the first 10 days the option was made available to the public.  The new practice – introduced March 13 – allows physicians to safely provide advice from a remote location, supports government’s direction for physical distancing and augments the province’s 811 HealthLine service and online assessment tool.

Testing and Contact Tracing Plan

With now more than 8,000 COVID-19 tests conducted by the Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory (RRPL), Saskatchewan ranks number three in the country for travel and non travel-related testing.  RRPL will continue to be the province’s source for reliable testing information.

In addition to ongoing testing, the Ministry of Health will deploy additional staff to the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) to assist with contact tracing.  This initiative is aimed at critical identification to better ensure cases are detected and followed up on in a timely manner, and to help prevent further transmission of COVID-19.

“We understand many people are eager to get out of the house and spend time outdoors,” Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Gene Makowsky said.  “However, our provincial parks are not where people should be congregating right now.  The health and safety of our visitors and staff is the main priority and we are supporting social distancing by closing these spaces, including visitor reception centres and washroom buildings.  We all need to do our part to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”

Saskatchewan Parks is following the advice of public health experts and implementing measures to support the Government of Canada’s efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  As of Monday, March 23, 2020, park facilities closed, meaning there is no access to washrooms, visitor centres, picnic areas, as well as campgrounds and campsites.

People should not gather in the parks at all.  Some trails are very narrow and do not provide the necessary space to maintain a healthy distance when passing people.

While park offices are closed, staff are still available by phone at 1-800-205-7070 or email at parks.info@gov.sk.ca to answer questions.

Sask Parks will be offering educational park programming and activities, starting Monday, March 30, through Facebook to encourage everyone to stay connected and have fun from home with various park-type activities.  Followers can expect daily programming at 10 a.m. from Monday to Friday.

For the latest updates regarding the 2020 campsite reservation launch and park opening information, please visit www.saskparks.com.  Sask Parks is monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely and will update information as needed.

At this time, we can confirm that two staff at Saskatoon Correctional Centre have been identified as having COVID-19 through testing.  These staff have been directed by public health authorities to self-isolate at home, and Corrections is working with public health authorities to determine who these individuals might have come into contact with within the correctional facility and what measures need to be taken as a result.

Staff who believe they are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 are asked to contact a health care provider and to notify their supervisor of their concerns.  We are working with health authorities to ensure corrections workers, like other essential service providers, receive priority testing for COVID-19.

Corrections will work with public health authorities to determine next steps if it is confirmed that a staff member has COVID-19.

Currently, no offenders in provincial correctional facilities have been confirmed as having COVID-19.  There is currently one unit at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre on quarantine as a precautionary measure for what is believed to be a non-COVID-19 illness.

The ministry is exploring how to more effectively manage the sentenced offender population in our provincial correctional facilities in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, and is using existing infrastructure and program space within correctional facilities to create additional separation between offenders and staff.

Nurses watch for symptoms of illness in the offender population and if symptoms are identified, they ensure prompt assessment, testing, documenting and reporting of offenders suspected or confirmed to have a communicable disease.

When there is a suspected illness among the offender population in a custody facility, the facility director ensures that disease specific precautions are put in place, including the use of medical cells or other isolated areas.

Personal protective equipment is being provided to corrections staff and offenders based on criteria established by the World Health Organization and public health authorities.

Other measures being taken include:

restricting the movement and placement of offenders within the facility;
suspending or limiting programming to smaller groups of offenders to ensure adequate social distancing;
increased communication to staff and offenders about proper hygiene and contagious disease precautions;
enhancing cleaning protocols in all facilities for common areas and equipment; and
thorough and regular handwashing with soap and water by facility staff.

1012,2020-03-26,,Canada,Saskatchewan,,Evictions suspended during pandemic,Public Announcement,General,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/march/26/evictions-suspended,Government of Saskatchewan,,Government Website,Evictions Suspended Due To COVID-19,"Government is temporarily suspending eviction hearings as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.

Starting today, the Office of Residential Tenancies (ORT) will not be accepting applications for eviction related to missed or late rent, or for other non-urgent claims.  Previous eviction orders for non-urgent matters (i.e. – not related to health and safety concerns) will not be enforced, and previously scheduled hearings for non-urgent matters have been cancelled as of today.

The ORT will only be conducting eviction hearings for urgent situations where there is a potential risk to health or safety resulting from violence or damage to property.  Hearings may also take place for situations where a tenant has been locked out by their landlord or where a landlord has been accused of not providing essential services such as power and water.

“Under the circumstances, we want to ensure that tenants facing hardship as a result of COVID-19 can remain in their homes and follow all orders and recommendations from the Chief Medical Health Officer,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan said.  “An essential part of flattening the curve is staying home and self-isolating.  We want to provide piece of mind that those taking the necessary precautions as a result of this unprecedented situation will still have a roof over their head.”

Tenants who are unable to pay their rent during the state of emergency will be expected to pay their rent in full once the state of emergency is over.  This action is being taken in recognition of the fact that our province is currently in an unprecedented state of emergency that may result in unforeseen financial hardship or health consequences for tenants.

Government is specifically concerned that evicted tenants will be unable to self-isolate or physically distance themselves from others, potentially increasing the risk of transmitting or contracting COVID-19.

The ORT continues to encourage landlords and tenants to communicate with each other about their individual situations so that they can come to mutually agreeable solutions in this challenging time.

Additionally, clarity is being provided to Saskatchewan businesses surrounding the operations of allowable business services, in consultation with the Chief Medical Health Officer.  A list of critical public services and allowable business services has been created to inform the business community of which businesses can continue to operate in accordance with social distancing practices.  All changes are effective March 26, 2020.

“As we impose further restrictions to fight the spread of COVID-19, we know this creates challenges for businesses in Saskatchewan and we know that providing as much clarity as possible is important,” Premier Scott Moe said.  “We are already seeing the creation of a social distancing economy in Saskatchewan as many businesses adapt their service delivery to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”

Critical Public Services and Allowable Business Services

The government is releasing a comprehensive list of critical public services and business services that will be allowed to continue operating during the COVID-19 response and maintaining critical services to the public and industry to prevent supply chain disruption.

The list includes: health care and public health workers; law enforcement, public safety and first responders; production, processing and manufacturing and the supporting supply chains; transportation and logistics; government and community services; media and telecommunications; construction including maintenance and repair; select retail services; and banking and financial services.

The full list is available in the attached backgrounder.

Non-Allowable Business Services

Effective March 26, non-allowable business services will be unable to provide public-facing services.  While closure of non-allowable business services prevents certain businesses from providing public facing services, it does not preclude opportunities for non-allowable business services to expand into online retailing, or providing pick-up or delivery services.

Examples of non-allowable business services that will be prohibited from providing public-facing services includes: clothing stores; shoe stores; flower shops; sporting good and adventure stores; vaping supply shops; boats, ATV, or snowmobile retailers; gift, book, or stationary stores; jewelry and accessory stores; toy stores; music, electronic and entertainment stores; pawn shops; and travel agencies.

This is in addition to the following business services that were ordered closed on March 23:

Restaurants, food courts, cafeterias, cafes, bistros and similar facilities.  Exceptions are take-out with two metre distancing between customers during pick-up; drive through food services; delivery of food products; soup kitchens, not-for-profit community and religious kitchens with two metre distancing between tables.

Personal service facilities including tattooists, hairdressers, barbers, acupuncturists, acupressurists, cosmetologists, electrologists, estheticians, manicurists, pedicurists, suntanning parlours, relaxation masseuses, facilities performing body piercing, bone grafting or scarification services.

All recreational and entertainment facilities including fitness centers, casinos, bingo halls, arenas, curling rinks, swimming pools, galleries, theatres, museums and similar facilities.

Dental, optometrist, chiropractic, registered massage therapy and podiatry clinics except for non-elective procedures.

Supports for Business and Employers (Previously Announced)

Public and Private Gatherings Restricted to 10 Person Maximum

Effective March 26, public and private gatherings of more than 10 people in one room are prohibited. Exceptions are provided where two metre distancing between people can be maintained, such as: workplaces and meeting settings where people are distributed into multiple rooms or buildings; and retail locations deemed essential.

Social Distancing in the Workplace

Workplaces must ensure their occupational health and safety guidelines are up to date and in force to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses.

Workers must follow personal protective measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.

All travellers returning from international destinations – including the U.S. – are subject to a mandatory self-isolation order.  Anyone identified by a Medical Health Officers as a close contact of someone with COVID-19 shall go into mandatory self-isolation for 14 days from the date of having been exposed.  Exempted are truckers, airline, rail, and work crews that are required to work in order to maintain business continuity and are supervised by Infection Prevention and Control Officers or Occupational Health and Safety in the workplace.
Actively monitor for symptoms.  At the first sign of cough, immediately self-isolate for 14 days.
Practice physical distancing in the workplace. Maintain a two metre separation between individuals.
Wash your hands often. Cough/sneeze into your elbow or tissue and wash your hands immediately.

Funding from both the province and Ottawa will support the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization – International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac).

The lab is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks.

“Saskatchewan is leading the global effort to find a vaccine and we are providing our researchers with additional support to continue and to share their life-saving work with Canadians and people around the world,” Minister Responsible for Innovation Saskatchewan Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.

VIDO-InterVac scientists were the first in Canada to isolate the virus that causes COVID-19, in collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Canada and a research facility in Toronto.  They expect to know in mid-April whether their vaccine works in an animal model.  Clinical testing can start once VIDO-InterVac provides enough preliminary data for Health Canada to determine the candidate vaccine is safe in humans.

“The Government of Canada is committed to protecting the health and safety of Canadians,” said Navdeep Bains, Federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry.  “We are all in this together: Canada is benefiting from the impressive and innovative power of our researchers at Saskatoon’s VIDO-InterVac in our national approach to fight COVID-19.   Together, we are rapidly scaling-up our capacity in research and in manufacturing to combat this pandemic.”

Since the outbreak of the coronavirus in January, the Government of Saskatchewan has provided researchers in Saskatoon with a total of $4.2 million.  VIDO-InterVac also received $1 million through the federal rapid research funding initiative for COVID-19 research projects, in addition to the $23 million in federal funding announced on March 23 for the centre’s manufacturing facility to produce COVID-19 vaccines for clinical trials, and overall operational costs.

“This funding helps fast track vaccine development for emerging infections including COVID-19,” VIDO-InterVac Director and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Volker Gerdts said.  “We very much appreciate the Government of Saskatchewan and the Federal Government’s continued support of our research and development efforts in these challenging times.”

This is one part of the SHA’s overall strategy to contain, delay and mitigate COVID-19.

“Based on what we know from other jurisdictions, it is critical we act immediately to expand acute care capacity to mitigate the impact of COVID-19,” SHA CEO Scott Livingstone said.  “Demand will exceed capacity.  All jurisdictions are facing this challenge.  We are not alone.  We are acting immediately to ensure Saskatchewan residents get the care they need from the right provider, at the right time, with the right supports in place.”

Modelling from other jurisdictions suggests that this virus may affect 30 per cent of the population and result in thousands needing hospitalization.  This modelling is being updated to ensure it is more specific to the situation in Saskatchewan.

“Under any scenario, it is critical that we continue to act to escalate our tactics to meet the potential demand,” Livingstone said.  “That is why we are stepping up actions on an ongoing basis to do our part in ensuring the safety of Saskatchewan people.”

The SHA has already initiated measures to ensure this demand is met.  A slowdown of non-essential services to increase bed availability, preserve supplies and support a labour pool for reallocation is already underway.

SHA leadership is activating plans to create additional capacity through:

Creation of dedicated spaces to cohort COVID-19 patients within facilities.
Creation of COVID-19 designated hospitals in Saskatoon and Regina and other areas of the province, where required.
Creation of additional community based acute care capacity where required (e.g. field hospitals in school gyms, community centres, rinks, etc.).
“This plan will ensure we are prepared,” Livingstone said.  “But it won’t be enough; it has been proven over and over with this virus that no health system in the world can address this challenge alone without the sustained help of the general public.”

Actions that people and communities must take to address this challenge include:

Practicing good hygiene, washing hands regularly and practicing social distancing (two meters apart wherever possible);
Abide by provincial and local travel, self-isolation, event and gathering restrictions;
Use medical supplies effectively and efficiently so that they are there when needed;
Avoid visiting our hospitals and long-term care facilities unless there are compassionate reasons for doing so.
A provincial Emergency Operations Centre has been established, as well as Integrated Health Incident Command Centres (IHICCs) for each of the SHA service areas (Saskatoon, Regina, Rural and North).

It is these local IHICC’s that will be accountable for finalizing and deploying the continuity of services and surge capacity plans on a local level.  Changes to services and service locations are already occurring and will be ongoing as we adapt to the increased capacity it will take for the health system to effectively manage the weeks and months ahead.  Communities will be updated as changes occur in their areas.

“We strongly urge every resident in Saskatchewan to abide by the restrictions, guidelines and orders enacted by the Government of Saskatchewan, and help our province slow the rate of transmission of this virus,” SHA Chief Medical Officer Dr. Susan Shaw said.  “The success of preventive measures will have a direct impact on health system demand for hospital care.  The actions of the public will help save lives and ensure our health system is there for when you need it, regardless of the circumstance.”

Self-Isolation

As individuals, we are responsible for ensuring our actions do not put others at risk of COVID-19.
All travelers returning from international destinations - including the U.S. - are subject to a mandatory self-isolation order.  Anyone identified by a Ministry of Health Official as a close contact of someone with COVID-19 shall go into mandatory self-isolation for 14 days from the date of having been exposed.

Do not go to work or school.
Do not go to public areas, including places of worship, stores, shopping malls and restaurants.
Cancel or reschedule non-urgent appointments; let them know you are on self-isolation.
Do not take buses, taxis or ride-sharing where you would be in contact with others.
Do not have visitors in your home.
Ask family/friends to drop off food or use delivery/pick-up services for errands such as grocery shopping.
You may go outdoors - use your backyard, walk on your street or exercise outdoors - but only if you have no symptoms and can maintain the required social distance of two metres at all times.  You must maintain proper hand hygiene and avoid contact with shared surfaces like handrails, pedestrian crosswalk buttons and outdoor playground equipment.  Avoid all common spaces within shared accommodations like apartments and condominiums (ie. elevators, hallways) and public places where you cannot maintain this distance..

With even mild symptoms of a cough, you must self-isolate indoors to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

","Today, Premier Scott Moe announced a significant financial support plan for Saskatchewan employers and employees hit by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“During this time of great uncertainty, it is of the utmost importance that Saskatchewan people know their government is here to provide support,” Moe said.  “This plan supports businesses and employees. Most importantly, it supports the opportunity to come back to work when we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis.”

The financial support plan outlines a number of mechanisms for reducing costs for businesses and individuals, providing support to self-employed individuals not covered by new federal support measures, and establishes a Business Response Team designated to support Saskatchewan businesses during this time of uncertainty.

Self-Isolation Support Program

Administered by the Ministry of Finance, the Self-Isolation Support Program will provide $450 per week, for a maximum of two weeks or $900.  The Self-Isolation Support Program is targeted at Saskatchewan residents forced to self-isolate that are not covered by recent federally announced employment insurance programs and other supports.  The program is designed to ensure that all Saskatchewan residents are covered by either a federal or provincial program to ensure no one is faced with choosing to work instead of protecting their family and community from COVID-19 by self-isolating.

The program is anticipated to cost a total of $10 million and will mostly benefit self-employed residents of Saskatchewan that meet the following eligibility criteria:

They have contracted COVID-19 or are showing symptoms;
They have been in contact with an individual infected with COVID-19;
They have recently returned from international travel and have been required to self-isolate;
AND

If they are not eligible for compensation including sick leave, vacation leave from their employer
If they do not have private insurance covering such disruptions
If they are not covered by other programs such as federal employment insurance that has been updated.
Three Month PST Remittance Deferral and Audit Suspension

Effective immediately, Saskatchewan businesses who are unable to remit their PST due to cashflow concerns will have relief from penalty and interest charges.  Over the course of three-months; government estimates a potential deferral of up to $750 million in PST collections.  Businesses that are unable to file their provincial tax return(s) by the due date may submit a request for relief from penalty and interest charges on the return(s) affected.

At this time, audit program and compliance activities have been suspended to allow businesses time to focus on the health and safety of their customers and staff, reduce impacts to their business operations, and minimize the spread of the virus through reduced audit travel.

Crown Utility Interest Deferral Programs

Earlier this week, government announced a crown utility interest deferral program waving interest on late bill payments for up to six months.  Effective immediately, the crown utility interest deferral program is available to all crown utility customers.

Student Loan Repayment Moratorium

Effective immediately, a six-month student loan repayment moratorium has been put in place, mirroring a similar federal provision.  This provides individuals with student loans immediate relief, and comes at a $4 million cost to the provincial government.

Changes to Employment Standard Regulations

In addition to changes made to changes to The Saskatchewan Employment Act that introduced a new unpaid public health emergency leave and removed the 13-week employment requirement to access sick leave and the requirement for a doctor’s note to access sick leave, The Employment Standard Regulations have been amended to:

Ensure that during a public emergency, businesses will not have to provide notice or pay in lieu of notice when they lay-off staff if it is for a period of 12 weeks or less in a 16-week period.
And if an employer lays off employees periodically for a total of more than 12 weeks in a 16-week period, the employees are considered to be terminated and are entitled to pay instead of notice as outlined in the Act.  This will be calculated from the date on which the employee was laid off.
These amendments create a balance for employers and employees where the difficult decision may be made to lay-off employees due to public health emergencies.  In this circumstance, employees would have immediate access to new federal employment insurance programs, while keeping employers financially stable to ensure employees have a job to return to.

Business Response Team to be Established

To provide support to Saskatchewan businesses seeking to navigate the uncertain conditions caused by COVID-19, the Government of Saskatchewan will be establishing a single window information webpage for businesses to access information and receive timely updates on provincial support initiatives.  This will be complemented by the establishment of a Business Response Team, led by the Ministry of Trade and Export Development, which will work with businesses to identify program supports relevant to particular businesses. Once the Business Response Team has been established, contact information will be communicated to the public, and to local chambers of commerce for dissemination to chamber membership.

The provincial total for cases is now 20: 12 are presumptive positive and eight are now confirmed, following verification from the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

Surveillance information on COVID-19 cases and testing is available at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19. Public health officials are completing contact investigations on all cases now.

Three of the four presumptive positive cases are related to travel and one is a close contact of a previously reported case.  Nineteen of the twenty cases are well enough to self-isolate at home at present; one presumptive positive case is in hospital for medical reasons not related to COVID-19.

On March 18, the Government of Saskatchewan implemented a number of measures to support social distancing and prevent the transmission of COVID-19.

These include:

Prohibiting public gatherings larger than 50 people are prohibited;
Closing all gyms, fitness centres, casinos and bingo halls; and
Limiting all restaurants, bars and event venues seating to 50 per cent of capacity or up to a maximum of fifty people, whichever is lesser and must be able to ensure social distance of one to two metres between customers. Retail spaces including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations are exempt from this policy but must have processes to maintain a one to two metre separation between customers.
The Government of Saskatchewan has introduced amendments to The Saskatchewan Employment Act to remove the provision requiring a doctor’s note or certificate in order to access leave.

Requesting written verification from physicians or HealthLine 811 is unnecessary and prevents these resources from being properly utilized at this time. All workplaces and organizations should be implementing their business continuity plans or assessing the risk of exposure and transmission for their staff and clients and make operational decisions accordingly.

Self-Isolation

Self-isolation is required for 14 days after returning from travel outside Canada; for individuals who have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19; and for individuals who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and well enough to stay at home. Self-isolation means staying home and avoiding situations where there is a potential to spread respiratory illness to others: work, school, sporting events, social, cultural and religious gatherings and public places such as restaurants and malls. Avoid public transportation. If a member of your household is self-isolating, they should make every effort to stay apart from the other members of that household. This includes separate sleeping areas and bathrooms, if possible.

Maintain social distancing (one to two metres) with members of your household. Do not share utensils, bedding, electronic devices, etc. and clean high-touch-shared surfaces frequently. If you are sharing living space with someone who is self-isolating, you are required to self-monitor. This means actively monitoring for symptoms including taking your temperature twice daily. Be prepared to self-isolate immediately yourself if you develop a fever or cough.

Should I be tested?

This includes measures like the ability to limit travel to or from a community or region of the province and directing that property or equipment be deployed to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The government, in consultation with the Chief Medical Health Officer, also made a number of new orders to reduce the risk to Saskatchewan people, prevent transmission and ensure that acute care services are preserved for residents most at risk for severe illness.

The following measures are effective immediately:

Public gatherings larger than 50 people are prohibited.
All restaurants, bars and event venues must limit their seating to 50 per cent of capacity or up to a maximum of fifty people, whichever is lesser.  All must be able to ensure social distance of one to two metres between customers.  Retail spaces including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations are exempted from this policy but must have processes to maintain a one to two metre separation.
All gyms, fitness centres, casinos and bingo halls are ordered to close until further notice.
Residents are advised to limit any non-essential travel outside of Saskatchewan, with the exception of people who live in border communities and are commuting for work.
Any licensed restaurants and taverns in Saskatchewan will be permitted to sell alcohol as an offsale according to SLGA regulations indefinitely.
All crown utilities will implement bill-deferral programs allowing a zero-interest bill deferral for up to six months for Saskatchewan residents whose ability to make bill payments may be impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions.
All Government of Saskatchewan ministries, agencies and Crown corporations will implement a phased-in work from home policy effective Monday, March 23, applicable to employees deemed non-essential.  This means that any employees able to work from home should do so immediately, while providing managers a period to plan for work-force continuity.
The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) will be discontinuing all non-urgent/elective surgeries, procedures and diagnostics as of March 23.  This action will allow the SHA the ability to redeploy nurses and other staff and ensure medical supplies and personal protective equipment are available when needed and reduce risk of further exposure to our care providers and patients.

The SHA will continue to provide services to patients who require emergent and urgent care.  Cancer, urgent and emergent surgeries will continue as planned.  Patients will be contacted regarding their scheduled service.

Parents with children in daycares should be preparing for further restrictions.

“We want to thank workers across Saskatchewan for everything they do,” Labour Relations and Workplace Safety Minister Don Morgan said.  “No one should lose their job for continuing to prioritize health and safety during this public health emergency.”

The proposed amendments to the Act are:

to remove the requirement of 13 consecutive weeks of employment with the employer prior to accessing sick leave;
to remove the provision requiring a doctor’s note or certificate; and
introduction of a new unpaid public health emergency leave that can be accessed:
when the World Health Organization has determined that there is a public health emergency and the province’s chief medical health officer has also issued an order that measures be taken to reduce the spread of a disease; or
the province’s chief medical health officer has independently issued an order that measures be taken provincially to reduce the spread of a disease where it is believed there is sufficient risk of harm to citizens of the province.  The orders would also be made public to ensure everyone is aware of the direction.
The amendments to the Act would come into force retroactive to March 6, 2020.

“We also want to thank the members of the Opposition for their assistance in moving this act forward in a timely way so that employees have the peace of mind needed during public health emergencies,” Morgan said.

The Royal Saskatchewan Museum (RSM) at 2445 Albert Street in Regina will be closed effective today, March 17, 2020, until further notice.

“When open to the public, the RSM welcomes visitors of all ages, backgrounds and locations including school groups and families,” Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Gene Makowsky said.  “We believe that closing the RSM is taking a proactive approach to promoting social distancing to stop the spread of this virus.  We apologize for the inconvenience and look forward to reopening in the future.”

The T.rex Discovery Centre in Eastend, Saskatchewan, which is also home to Scotty, the world’s largest T.rex, is not scheduled to open until May 16, 2020, for the summer season.

As concerns regarding the spread of the COVID-19 virus elevate, the RSM joins other public facilities in taking this action to help encourage people to stay home and avoid public places where the virus could potentially spread.  Ideally, the museum will reopen once public health authorities determine it is safe to do so.

During the physical closure of the RSM, social media and website updates will keep followers engaged on https://royalsaskmuseum.ca/, Facebook (@Royal.Saskatchewan.Museum), Twitter (@royalsaskmuseum) or Instagram (@RoyalSaskMuseum).

For the period of March 16 to March 19, pre K-12 classes will wind down.  This means that parents who are able to keep children home should do so immediately, with no absence or grade impacts.  Parents with limited childcare options have a window to plan for class suspensions.

On Sunday, March 15, the Chief Medical Health Officer indicated that school closures would be based on a number of factors including:

Evidence of sustained transmission within the community;
Rapid increase of local cases; and
Transmission without a known link to travel or confirmed cases.
There continues to be no evidence that any of the above three criteria have been met.  Children remaining in schools between March 16 and March 19 face a low risk of exposure to COVID-19.  A preventative approach of proactive school closures beginning March 20 means reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

Every student will receive a final grade based on their current grade, and students will progress to their next grade level next year.  Every student who is eligible to graduate from Grade 12 this year will graduate.  The Ministry of Education and School Divisions will work with Saskatchewan Post-Secondary Institutions to adapt entry requirements for programs commencing in the next academic year.

Teachers and staff can work from home or in schools as scheduled during the class cancellations.  For the rest of the scheduled school year, the Ministry of Education will work with School Divisions and Saskatchewan Teachers to implement a supplemental curriculum program through distance and alternative learning methods.  While this supplemental curriculum will have no impact on final grades, it will ensure that students seeking to continue learning will have the resources necessary to do so.

These measures apply to daycares that are co-located with schools, but do not apply to licensed daycare facilities outside of schools.  Further measures regarding licensed daycare facilities are being considered and will be implemented at a later date.

Officials are currently examining options to provide childcare services for individuals that are providing essential services during the COVID-19 response.

One resident, a health care worker in their 30s, has a recent history of travel to Nigeria and Germany, as well as Alberta.  The individual is recovering in northern Saskatchewan.

Two presumptive cases are in their 40s and live in the same household in Regina.  One recently travelled to Vancouver for a dental conference at which an attendee was later confirmed to have COVID-19.  The two Saskatchewan residents were tested March 13 and are self-isolating while they recover.

The fourth new case is an individual in their 20s with a history of travel to Tennessee, U.S., who was tested in Regina and is now self-isolating and recovering in their home community.

Public Health officials are following up with individuals who had close contact with all of these cases and who may be at risk of developing COVID-19.  You will be notified if you are a close contact and need to take further measures.

New Travel Guidance for Residents Travelling Internationally and Returning to Saskatchewan:

The Federal Government and Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer recommend returning to Canada and avoiding non-essential international travel until further notice.

All travellers returning from international destinations - including the United States – need to self-isolate and monitor their health for 14 days upon return.  Travellers returning from within Canada are advised to self-monitor for 14 days upon return.  Members of the public who have travelled outside the province in the previous 14 days should not visit hospitals or long-term care facilities.

COVID-19 INFORMATION:

We understand that residents have questions about COVID-19 in Saskatchewan.

If you have recently travelled internationally and are experiencing respiratory or flu-like symptoms, please call HealthLine 811.

","Today, Premier Scott Moe, Health Minister Jim Reiter and Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab announced new measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan.

The Chief Medical Health Officer of Saskatchewan has made the following order pursuant to Section 45 of The Public Health Act effective Monday, March 16:

The Chief Medical Health Officer orders that no public gathering of over 250 people in any one room take place.  This does not include settings where people are distributed into multiple rooms or buildings, such as schools, universities or workplaces.
The Chief Medical Health Officer orders that no events of over 50 people with speakers or attendees who have travelled internationally in the last 14 days take place.
Retail locations and Faith based organizations are exempt, however, they should have measures (such as crowd size monitoring) that support safe social distancing and should seek guidance from the local medical health officer if necessary.
Effective immediately, people who have travelled outside the province in the previous 14 days or have acute respiratory or flu-like symptoms should avoid visiting long term care homes and hospitals.
Additionally, the Government of Saskatchewan as an employer is imposing a number of policies regarding government employee travel, as well as self-monitoring and self-isolation procedures:

Effective immediately, international travel (including the U.S.) for government employees on government business has been prohibited.
Any out-of-province travel for government employees on government business within Canada will be restricted and is subject to approval by the Deputy Minister to the Premier.
Any government employees who are currently travelling internationally (including to the U.S.), or plan to travel internationally for personal reasons will be required to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to Canada as a precaution.  If they have or develop acute respiratory or flu-like symptoms, they should contact Healthline 811.
All government employees who are experiencing symptoms of an acute respiratory or flu-like illness will be required to stay at home.
While these measures are being implemented as a policy for Government of Saskatchewan ministries, crowns, and agencies, the Chief Medical Health Officer strongly recommends that all employers and individuals across the province adopt these measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan, protect residents from exposure to the virus and reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health system.

In keeping with these new policies, budget day events on Wednesday, March 18, will proceed without the participation of invited guests.  Members of the Legislative Assembly, media, and a limited number of staff will gather for these events while practicing social distancing.  Further, all tours and public events at the Legislative Building are suspended and general public access to the Legislative Building will also be suspended.

Concerns regarding Healthline 811 have been heard, and following an action plan ordered by the Minister of Health, the capacity of Healthline 811 has been more than doubled effective 9 a.m. this morning, with additional capacity being added going forward.

The Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority continue to work together to expand testing capacity for COVID-19, including the introduction of COVID-19 assessment sites over the coming days.

“While these are significant steps that will help limit transmission of COVID-19, most important is the responsibility we all have to ensure we reduce the risk to ourselves, our families and our communities,” Moe said.  “The best way we can do this is by practicing social distancing, washing our hands often, avoiding close personal contact like handshakes or hugs, and self isolating if we feel any symptoms of illness.”

","Today, Premier Scott Moe, Health Minister Jim Reiter and Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab announced new measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan.

The Chief Medical Health Officer of Saskatchewan has made the following order pursuant to Section 45 of The Public Health Act effective Monday, March 16:

The Chief Medical Health Officer orders that no public gathering of over 250 people in any one room take place.  This does not include settings where people are distributed into multiple rooms or buildings, such as schools, universities or workplaces.
The Chief Medical Health Officer orders that no events of over 50 people with speakers or attendees who have travelled internationally in the last 14 days take place.
Retail locations and Faith based organizations are exempt, however, they should have measures (such as crowd size monitoring) that support safe social distancing and should seek guidance from the local medical health officer if necessary.
Effective immediately, people who have travelled outside the province in the previous 14 days or have acute respiratory or flu-like symptoms should avoid visiting long term care homes and hospitals.
Additionally, the Government of Saskatchewan as an employer is imposing a number of policies regarding government employee travel, as well as self-monitoring and self-isolation procedures:

Effective immediately, international travel (including the U.S.) for government employees on government business has been prohibited.
Any out-of-province travel for government employees on government business within Canada will be restricted and is subject to approval by the Deputy Minister to the Premier.
Any government employees who are currently travelling internationally (including to the U.S.), or plan to travel internationally for personal reasons will be required to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to Canada as a precaution.  If they have or develop acute respiratory or flu-like symptoms, they should contact Healthline 811.
All government employees who are experiencing symptoms of an acute respiratory or flu-like illness will be required to stay at home.
While these measures are being implemented as a policy for Government of Saskatchewan ministries, crowns, and agencies, the Chief Medical Health Officer strongly recommends that all employers and individuals across the province adopt these measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan, protect residents from exposure to the virus and reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health system.

In keeping with these new policies, budget day events on Wednesday, March 18, will proceed without the participation of invited guests.  Members of the Legislative Assembly, media, and a limited number of staff will gather for these events while practicing social distancing.  Further, all tours and public events at the Legislative Building are suspended and general public access to the Legislative Building will also be suspended.

Concerns regarding Healthline 811 have been heard, and following an action plan ordered by the Minister of Health, the capacity of Healthline 811 has been more than doubled effective 9 a.m. this morning, with additional capacity being added going forward.

The Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority continue to work together to expand testing capacity for COVID-19, including the introduction of COVID-19 assessment sites over the coming days.

“While these are significant steps that will help limit transmission of COVID-19, most important is the responsibility we all have to ensure we reduce the risk to ourselves, our families and our communities,” Moe said.  “The best way we can do this is by practicing social distancing, washing our hands often, avoiding close personal contact like handshakes or hugs, and self isolating if we feel any symptoms of illness.”

The resident is in their 60s with travel from Oregon state in the U.S.  The test was conducted in Saskatoon on March 10 and the individual has been well enough to self-isolate at home.

Public health officials have begun their contact investigation to follow up on anyone who may be at risk of developing COVID-19 because of contact with this individual.

If you do not receive a call from public health, you are not at risk of transmission of COVID-19 from this individual.  The Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory reported the positive lab sample March 13, 2020, and has forwarded it to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation.

“All travelers – including those to the U.S. -- need to monitor their health for 14 days upon return to Canada and be prepared to stay home if you have a fever or cough,” Saskatchewan Ministry of Health Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said.

According to current research on COVID-19, eighty per cent of individuals who contract COVID-19 will experience only mild symptoms.  They will be able to self-isolate and recover at home.  Monitoring for symptoms and staying home when you are sick is important to prevent transmission and ensure acute care resources are reserved for those at highest risk of severe illness.

Travel Guidance

The Public Health Agency of Canada is recommending residents postpone or cancel all non-essential travel outside of Canada.  All travellers should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough or difficulty breathing) for 14 days after returning to Canada and avoid places where you cannot easily separate yourself from others if you become ill.  If you have even mild symptoms, stay home.

Healthline 811

Healthline 811 can assist you in assessing your risk and advise on whether you should seek testing:

If you have travelled in the past 14 days and have developed a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.
If you have been asked to self-isolate by healthcare providers and your symptoms become worse.
Protect Yourself from Respiratory Illness

Wash your hands frequently – for at least 20 seconds;
Do not touch surfaces and then your mouth, eyes or nose;
Use tissues when you cough or sneeze and dispose of them immediately; use your elbow if a tissue not available;
Practice social distancing by not shaking hands, hugging, etc.
Stay home if you become ill and prevent the spread of the illness; and
Clean “high touch” surfaces more often with disinfectant cleansers (ie. doorknobs, faucets, toys, remote controls, table and countertops).

The new virtual services, which will be supported through a new payment code for physicians, will enable patients to connect with physicians by telephone effective immediately.  The Ministry of Health is also working to provide patients with the ability to connect with doctors by secure video, which may be available as early as next week with physician offices that offer that option.

“Keeping Saskatchewan residents healthy and containing community transmission of this coronavirus is a priority for our government,” Health Minister Jim Reiter said.  “Provision of virtual care by telephone or video is just one strategy we are using to ensure residents have options for accessing health care.”

“The SMA is pleased with this development because it provides patients with remote access to physicians,” SMA President Dr. Allan Woo said.  “This kind of access also provides a safer work environment for doctors and their staff during this pandemic.  We need a healthy physician workforce to tackle the challenges presented by the outbreak of COVID-19.”

The risk to Saskatchewan residents still remains low, but all residents can help prevent the spread of COVID-19:

Wash your hands frequently;
Sneeze or cough into a tissue or your sleeve;
Practice social distancing; and
Stay home if you are sick.
The government is reminding patients that if they suspect they are ill as a result of a COVID-19 infection, they should first call HealthLine 811.

The resident is in their 60s with recent travel to Egypt.

Experiencing symptoms, the individual was tested March 9 in Saskatoon and has been well enough to self-isolate at home.  Public health officials are in regular contact with this individual.

“The province’s first case is linked to travel from a country where local transmission of COVID-19 has been reported,” Dr. Shahab said.   “This supports the expanded testing criteria of symptomatic travelers to better prepare Saskatchewan’s response to the COVID-19 event.  All travelers need to monitor their symptoms for two weeks upon return home.”

Public health’s contact investigation is underway and will connect with this individual’s close contacts.  If you do not receive a call from public health, you are not at risk of transmission of COVID-19 from this individual.

The Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory reported the positive lab sample March 12, 2020, and has forwarded it to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation.

“While the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in Saskatchewan continues to be low, increased testing will assist us in detecting cases as early as possible and delaying the spread of the illness as long as possible,” Shahab said.  “But it is critical that residents take precautions to protect themselves against respiratory illness.  Wash your hands frequently, practice good cough and sneeze hygiene and stay home if you are sick.”

“The Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority have dedicated planning teams in place,” Saskatchewan Health Minister Jim Reiter said.  “Our government is committed to providing the resources our public health system requires to mitigate and respond to COVID-19.”

Protect Yourself from Respiratory Illness:

 Wash your hands frequently – for at least 20 seconds;
Do not touch surfaces and then your mouth, eyes or nose;

The university’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre is at the forefront of a global search, having previously worked on vaccines for SARS and the Zika virus.  The Saskatoon lab is one of the few research facilities with regulatory approval to work on the new virus.

“Saskatchewan’s infectious disease researchers are among the best in the world and our government is proud to support their efforts in the development of a vaccine to protect against COVID-19,” Minister Responsible for Innovation Saskatchewan Tina Beaudry-Mellor says. USask researchers are evaluating the safety and efficiency of potential vaccines and medications to reduce the ability of the virus to multiply.  Both are key requirements for regulatory approval of new medicines.  The team hopes to know within weeks whether an effective vaccine has been developed.  If animal trials prove successful, clinical testing involving humans would take place as soon as possible.

“The Saskatchewan government is committed to providing innovators with the support to achieve results that impact people in our province and around the world,” Beaudry-Mellor said.

Collaborating with the World Health Organization and researchers in several countries, the Saskatoon team received a significant grant earlier this month from Canadian federal funding agencies - part of a $26.7-million rapid research initiative to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

“Support for this research is increasingly important as the disease continues to spread,” Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre Director and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Volker Gerdts said.  “This support will help in our worldwide efforts to develop a solution for this disease.”

With an increasing number of confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) around the world, the planning and preparedness of governments, organizations and individuals can still assist in containing and mitigating the spread of the illness.

The risk of COVID-19 to Saskatchewan residents remains low.  As of March 5, there are no laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province.

“With COVID-19 transmission occurring in many countries, Saskatchewan will be expanding testing criteria and increasing surveillance,” Saskatchewan Health’s Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said.  “Testing is important to ensure the healthcare system has the best possible information to ensure our facilities and staff are prepared for any cases that present in the province.  The most recent science indicates that 80 per cent of individuals who contract COVID-19 will experience only mild symptoms and will recover in their homes.  Protecting yourself from transmission and planning to stay home if you become sick will allow the healthcare system to focus on the most severe cases.”

Protect Yourself from Respiratory Illness:
• Wash your hands frequently;
• Do not touch surfaces and then your mouth, eyes or nose;
• Use tissues when you cough or sneeze and dispose of them immediately; use your elbow if a tissue not available;
• Stay home if you become ill and prevent the spread of the illness

Health System Preparedness

The Ministry of Health has a pandemic preparedness plan developed to address influenza.  Since COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, this plan will be adapted to respond to COVID-19.

This planning includes:
• Updated guidance to care providers on the case definition and testing procedures;
• Enhanced testing capability with Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory (RRPL);
• Reviewing acute care capacity and contingency planning; and
• Ensuring necessary supplies of personal protective equipment.

It is best practice for workplaces to have business continuity plans to support staff and work functions through an event like pandemic influenza.  It is recommended that workplaces ensure these plans are current and ready, in the event that cases increase in the province.

Travel Guidance

The active travel health notices and travel advice are available at Health Canada - Latest Travel Health Advice page.  Travelers from Hubei and Iran are being asked to contact public health officials upon return to Canada and self-isolate for 14 days after leaving those jurisdictions.  All travelers returning from countries where COVID-19 is circulating should actively monitor for symptoms of cough and fever.  If you develop symptoms, stay home and call HealthLine 811 for assessment and advice.

As of February 13, 2020, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province and the risk in Saskatchewan remains low.

“While the risk to residents in Saskatchewan remains low, we are working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada on preparedness, procedures and reporting to quickly identify and manage any cases that present for care,” Saskatchewan Ministry of Health’s Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said.  “Canada has multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond to the spread of serious infectious diseases like novel coronavirus.”

Information for the public and healthcare providers will be updated frequently and the public should check www.saskatchewan.ca/coronavirus for the latest information.

Public health’s advice as of February 13, 2020, is that anyone who has travelled from China’s Hubei province needs to self-isolate at home for 14 days from the date that they left Hubei.  Do not go to school, university, work or social events.  Actively monitor for symptoms such as fever and cough.  If even minor symptoms develop, call HealthLine 811 for further assessment and direction.  Those who have had close contact with a person ill with COVID-19 should also self-isolate and actively monitor for symptoms for 14 days from that point of contact.

People arriving from other parts of China need to actively monitor for symptoms and symptoms of their children for 14 days from the date that they left China.  If there are even mild symptoms (fever, cough), do not go to school or work and call HealthLine 811 for further assessment and direction.

These enhanced measures will support the province's extensive efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. On March 23, Ontario enacted a new order under the March 17, 2020declaration of emergency to ensure personnel are properly deployed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to keep staff, volunteers and residents in long-term care homes safe. This temporary order would give long-term care homes the ability to free-up valuable staff, identify staffing priorities, and develop, modify and implement redeployment plans. Under this temporary order long-term care homes will be able to respond to, prevent and alleviate an outbreak of COVID-19 by carrying out measures such as: Redeploying staff within different locations in (or between) facilities of the health service provider;Changingthe assignment of work, including assigning non-bargaining unit employees or contractors to perform bargaining unit work;Changing the scheduling of work or shift assignments;Deferringor cancelling vacations, absences or other leaves, regardless of whether such vacations, absences or leaves are established by statute, regulation, agreement or otherwise;Employing extra part-time or temporary staff or contractors, including for the purpose of performing bargaining unit work;Using volunteers to perform work, including to perform bargaining unit work; andProviding appropriate training or education as needed to staff and volunteers to achieve the purposes of a redeployment plan. Dr.David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, has also issued a new directive for long-term care homes under the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007that restricts residents from leaving a home for short visits with family and friends. In doing so, the province is ensuring residents do not inadvertently contract COVID-19 while out of the home and spread thevirus upon their return. Instead, residents who want to go outside willbe able to remain on the home's property and maintain safe social distancing from any family and friends who visit them. ""Ontario is implementing critical and necessary measures to ensure that we are able to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians, in particular our seniors,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We have been working for several months now, with all our partners across the system, from public health to hospitals and long-term care operators, to put processes in place to contain this virus and be ready to respond to any scenario."" ""The health and well-being of all Ontarians, including long-term care residents, their families, and staff will continue to be our government's number one priority,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Ourgovernment is taking all the necessary precautions to ensure our loved ones in Ontario's long-term care homes are safe and secure."" To help maintain the health and safety of residents, staff and essential visitors, Ontario is also increasing long-term care bed availability to ensure homes are able to provide isolation rooms when required, as well as providing long-term beds for people on the long-term care waitlist. In particular, patients in the hospital who no longer require hospital services will benefit from this increased long-term care bed capacity, and their placement into long-term care will also free up hospital beds to treat acute patients. In addition, Ontario is making necessaryadjustments to ensure both resident and families' wishes are taken intoaccount, and a sufficient number of staff are available to support long-term care home residents. Updated procedures will bring further clarity around admitting, discharging, and readmitting long-term care home residents at a time when homes are trying their best to prevent thespread of COVID-19 among residents, staff and essential visitors. Lastly,the province is ensuring sufficient nursing and personal support care staff are available to support long-term care home residents. All new nurses and personal support workers hired to help long-term care homes cope with COVID-19 will be screened to ensure they are qualified and present no risk to long-term care home residents. These critical steps add to the protocols that have recently been implemented to ensurea safe and secure environment for residents. Long-term care homes continue to restrict non-essential visits and actively screen essential visitors, staff, students, volunteers, residents moving into along-term care home and residents returning to a long-term care home. Asof March 9, 2020, when long-term care homes submit samples for standardrespiratory testing, they are also being tested for COVID-19 automatically to ensure the province identifies potentially unknown cases.Quick FactsWhen utilized by long-term care homes, redeployment plans under the new order temporarily supersede the provisions of a collectiveagreement, including lay-off, seniority/service or bumping provisions.As part of the ongoing government effort to prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19 across the province, the government has provided initial emergency funding to the long-term care home sector of $50 million effective immediately.Additional ResourcesVisit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

On March 13, we announced measures to protectOntario's adult correctional facilities from COVID-19 by granting intermittent inmates, who serve time on the weekends, temporary absencesfrom custody, and temporarily halting personal visits. Intermittent inmates have already been deemed low-risk by the courts and remain in the community Monday to Friday to live and work. Building on these changes, Ontario is implementing amendments to Regulation 778 under the Ministry of Correctional Services Act toallow senior corrections officials to expand the use of temporary absences and for the Ontario Parole Board to use alternatives to in-person meetings. Going forward, correctional services will have the option to issue temporary absences beyond the current 72-hour maximum. This means those serving intermittent sentences, who have been granted a temporary absence will not have to report to a correctional facility every weekend, which will avoid cycling individuals back and forth between the community and a correctional facility.  In addition, the longer-term temporary absences will allow for early release of those inmates who are near the end of their sentence. To ensure public safety, inmates would be carefully assessed to ensure theyare a low risk to reoffend. Those inmates who have been convicted of serious crimes, such as violent crimes or crimes involving guns, would not be considered for early release. A second regulatory amendment will allow the Ontario Parole Board to conduct hearings by electronic or written means, rather than solely in-person, providing alternate options for hearings. We continue to evaluate all options to limit the possible spread of COVID-19 within our correctionalsystem. These regulatory amendments will help us preserve the integrityof our health care system, protect our frontline workers and help keep our communities safe.""",

1107,2020-03-16,,Canada,Ontario,,First evidence of community transmission,General case announcement,General,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-waking-up-to-new-reality-amid-evidence-of-covid-19-community-spread-1.5499768,Chief Medical Officer of Health (Toronto),,Accredited News Agency,Toronto waking up to new reality amid 'evidence' of COVID-19 community spread,"Life will feel a little different this morning. You'll wake up to sunlight streaming through your windows, or maybe a jarring alarm clock, like always. You'll stretch, rub the sleep out of your eyes, like always. You'll turn on the radio. Make a coffee. Brush your teeth. Like always.

But for most people, that's about where the usual routine ends. 

By the time you're reading this, it's now after 12:01 A.M. on March 17, 2020, which marked the anticipated start of a new reality in Toronto based on public health recommendations to shut down much of the city.

It means you won't be stopping by your local brunch spot. You won't be heading to your favourite spin class. You won't be sitting in a busy bar to grab a pint for St. Patrick's Day.

All those pit-stops outside your house are on hold, and the hope is hitting pause on everyday life means Canada's largest city eventually gets to keep on living, without the pressure-cooker of a COVID-19 outbreak looming over our health-care system.

On Monday, the city's medical officer of health, Dr. Eileen De Villa, announced sweeping measures expected to start before sunrise on Tuesday: all Toronto bars, nightclubs, theatres, and restaurants — with the exception of take-out options — were asked to close, or risk facing a $25,000 daily fine under provincial health protection legislation.

Many other Toronto businesses have already shuttered voluntarily, from fitness centres to hair salons.

Update: On Tuesday morning, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in the province, which included mandating the closure of restaurants and bars, though those that can offer takeout and delivery can continue selling food.

The province is also prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people, including at indoor recreation centres, theatres and concert venues, libraries, places of worship, private schools and daycares, until March 31.

The bold measures, echoing and similar efforts in other global cities, come as residents are facing a new, unsettling reality.

""We have some evidence of community transmission,"" she told reporters on Monday.

'The time is now to act': COVID-19 spreading in Canada with no known link to travel, previous cases
Community spread of COVID-19 cannot be ruled out in Ontario, public health officials say
Community transmission refers to public health experts' inability to track a large number of confirmed cases along a clear chain back to an original source, according to the World Health Organization. 

In other words, this new coronavirus is no longer ""over there,"" only entering Toronto's borders after hitching a ride on unsuspecting travellers.

Far more likely, it's now spreading, untraced, among residents, through the very interactions the city is calling on everyone to avoid.

'We're going to see more of it'
""We're going to see more of it,"" said noted global health specialist Steven Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab at York University in Toronto.

""For every case that we can't identify where it came from, we know there are probably some others out there that we don't yet know about.""

As of Monday night, there were three suspected cases of community transmission in Toronto, according to Toronto Public Health. The city is currently monitoring at least 96 confirmed cases in total.

Stop serving customers except for takeout and delivery, Toronto health officials tell restaurants, bars
Cases of community transmission likely in Montreal, city's public health director says
The challenge, Hoffman said, is that finding out which cases are based on community transmission is both labour-intensive and time consuming. 

It goes something like this: someone likely shows symptoms; then seeks medical attention; then goes for a test; then waits for results.

 Then a positive result is sent to a public health team; then that team tracks the patient down; then asks them where they've been; then finds out who they've been in contact with.

""Every time we identify new cases, that actually represents information from a few days ago, right?"" Hoffman continued.

""From the time someone is infected, shows symptoms, gets a test, several days have passed — so we're always, in a sense, looking at a shadow of the latest information.""

For that reason, he said public health agencies across the country have already been treating the situation as if community transmission was a future certainty, if not already happening.

Ottawa, for instance, is bracing for the possibility of up to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 throughout the community, despite only confirming a fraction of that number.

""One case is typically resulting in two cases, and the doubling time is about four or five days,"" according to Dr. Vera Etches, Ottawa's medical officer of health.

She added the city likely hasn't caught all the initial travel-related cases coming into Canada.

What to do if you think you have COVID-19: A guide to each province and territory
In Alberta, officials say two new cases were acquired through community transmission from an unknown source, so it's not known how many people in the community may actually have COVID-19. And in Calgary specifically, seven cases have been tied back to a single gathering.

A growing chorus of experts warn not taking bold action quickly across the country could lead to a situation like that of Italy or Spain, where death tolls spiked rapidly, putting immense, sudden pressure on each country's hospital network and prompting draconian mass quarantines.

On Monday, De Villa stressed she didn't make the decision lightly to call for closures and hijack residents' daily routines. But it was needed, she said, to keep people apart and ""protect the health of our city.""

And so, Toronto residents are facing a new normal: no brunch, no spin classes, no bar nights.

Life will feel a little different for a while.

Given the latest developments both internationally and here at home, including growing evidence of community spread, the province is taking further action to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Based on advice from Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams, Ontario is responding to the evolving situation by moving forward with new measures to help contain the virus,including the recommended closure of all recreational programs and libraries, private schools, daycares, churches and other faith settings,as well as bars and restaurants, except those that may only offer takeout or delivery. These closures would be in line with the updated guidance to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. We recognize that these measures will significantly impact the lives of many Ontarians. However, as the number of cases in Ontario continues to grow, we must heed the advice of our public health experts and take decisive action to protect the health and safety of the public, our government's top priority. As this situation continues to evolve,we are prepared to continue to respond quickly and effectively to any scenario to keep Ontarians safe.""

This is an evolving situation, and your role in helping to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is critical.It is imperative that we take steps now and take steps together to reduce opportunities for transmission. I am asking for your cooperation in following the advice below as best you can over the coming weeks. By working together, we can make a difference in this outbreak and protect those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, new cough and difficulty breathing, and these may occur within 14 days of an exposure to another case. Additional closures Iam strongly recommending a further limitation to public gatherings frommy advice on March 12, 2020. I am further advising Ontarians to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible: All recreational programs and librariesAll private schoolsAll daycaresAll churches and other faith settingsAll bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 Everyonein Ontario should be practicing social distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. This means that you can carry out daily activities, such as going to work (if you cannot work from home) and doing necessary shopping and appointments. I ask that everyone in Ontario does their best to avoid close contact with people outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within2 meters of another person.  In addition: If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, I recommend that you begin to self-monitorfor a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to social distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (e.g., sore throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care provider over the phone if you seek assessment services. All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your home or see other people for essential reasons.  Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.  If you have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days If you have travelled and are not a healthcare worker or another essential service worker, I ask that you self-isolate for 14 days since your arrival in Canada. People who are self-isolating should not go to work. In addition: Workerswho have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to daily living are able to return to work as long as they are asymptomatic. However, they should self-monitor for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those workplaces.Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at homeand avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks. Public Health Ontario has excellent fact sheets on how to self monitor and self isolate. If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19 I am requesting anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) to return home and self-isolateimmediately. People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealthwill direct you to in-person care options. If you are in medical distress and need urgent care, you should call 911 and let them know what you are self-isolating because of COVID-19. If you are an employer Iam asking all employers in Ontarians to facilitate virtual work arrangements to enable employees to work from home where possible to enable workers to limit their activities, care for children and to self isolate. However, I recognize that there are a number of workplaces where this is not possible. I would ask those employers to use their judgement to sustain operations in a manner that maintains social distancing.

You should not book an in-person visit for COVID-19 assessment without firsthaving a virtual assessment.  If you require an in-person health assessment, you will be referred to an appropriate location for in-person health assessment.  Only people with COVID-19 symptoms will be tested.  I want to remind all Ontarians that there are important actions that they should be taking every day inorder to protect your health. These include: washing your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizersneezing and cough into your sleeveavoid touching your eyes, nose or mouthavoid contact with people who are sickstayat home if you are sick. In particular, do not visit a long-term care, retirement home or other congregate living situation.  Thankyou for all of your support.

As I said last week, these developments are the latest reminder that Ontario is part of an integrated global economy. As Premier Ford has made clear,our government will ensure the necessary resources are in place to protect the health of people and our economy in this province. Circumstanceshave changed rapidly in recent days. Markets around the world are volatile.  Employers and workers are feeling the economic impacts. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. During that time, I have been in frequent conversations with various experts, my fellow finance ministers, business and union leaders, and mycolleagues at Queen's Park. At the request of Premier Ford, I have convened a regular meeting of the ministers in our government who share economic responsibilities. The work of that committee includes reaching out on a daily basis to leaders at businesses big and small, including at our financial institutions, as well as unions, to ensure wehave the latest information, and that there is an open line of communication as the government works to address COVID-19's impact on the economy.  In response to events here at home and around the world, private-sector economists have revised the economic outlook used to develop the 2020 Ontario Budget scheduled to be released next Wednesday. AsOntario's Minister of Finance, it is important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given thedynamic situation. So instead of a full Budget, I will release an economic and fiscal update on March 25 based on our best understanding of the current situation. This update will include a realistic one-year outlook based on current economic projections. It will provide certainty to hospitals, schools, municipalities, and other partners for the year to come. Our approach will include increased resources for our healthcare system, direct support for people, and action to protect jobsand our economy. This is a responsible course that maintains confidenceand stability, while providing the flexibility to respond quickly to changing events. We will build on our record of transparency, with regular financial updates as the situation evolves.  We will ensurethe people of Ontario are informed by the most up-to-date information that is available. And as you all know, that information is changing rapidly. It will also allow for close collaboration with our partners, including the federal government, to protect Ontario's economy. Experience has shown this work is most effective when governments collaborate. This is exactly what I have proposed to the federal government. I was pleased to sit down with my colleague, Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau in Ottawa last week. Wehave stayed in close contact over the weekend and I'll be participatingin a call with all of the provincial finance ministers later today. Ourgovernment will make additional resources available to ensure Ontario'shealth-care system is able to respond to any scenario.  Our health-careprofessionals have our backs. They can be confident their government has theirs. Finally, I want to reiterate Premier Ford's commitment to support people throughout this crisis. From washing your hands to checking in on the most vulnerable among us, the people of Ontario are acting responsibly and doing their part during this global pandemic. Their government will do its part as well. Premier Ford and Minister McNaughton just spoke about some important measures in that regard. Ontario'shas strong economic fundamentals. We have more fiscal flexibility to respond to these sort of global events through actions we've taken over the previous 18 months. I'm confident that by acting decisively, and working together with our partners, Ontario is well positioned to weather the challenges ahead.""Additional ResourcesThe 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)",

Today, Premier Doug Ford and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, announced that the government intends to introduce legislation that, if passed, would immediately provide job-protected leave to employees in isolation or quarantine due to COVID-19, or those who need to be away from work to care for children because of school or day care closures.""While everyone's concerns about their health and safety is top of mind, the last thing we need is anyone worrying about job security asthe COVID-19 situation evolves,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why I directed the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development to draft legislation that will protect workers and their families during this difficult period."" ""Mothers and fathers who need to care forchildren or dependants shouldn't have to worry about losing their job,""said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""The same goes for people who receive medical or public health advice and are required to take precautions as a result. They shouldn't have to worry about losing their job. In this time of uncertainty, we need to support employees who must isolate or quarantinethemselves, or who need to care for a loved one."" The proposed legislation would, if passed, provide job protection for employees unable to work for the following reasons: · The employee is under medical investigation, supervision or treatment for COVID-19. · The employee is acting in accordance with an order under the Health Protection and Promotion Act. · The employee is in isolation or quarantine. · The employee is acting in accordance with public health information or direction. · The employer directs the employee not to work. · The employee needs to provide care to a person for a reason related to COVID-19 such as a school or day-care closure. Theproposed legislation would also make it clear that an employee will notbe required to provide a medical note if they take the leave. The measures would be retroactive to January 25, 2020, the date that the first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in Ontario. Many workers will be eligible for Employment Insurance sickness benefits. As well, we are reviewing current access and eligibility to emergency assistance which is available through the Ontario Works (OW) program to support individuals who are impacted by the coronavirus and who are not able to meet their basic living expenses. ""The health and well-being of Ontarians continues to be our government's number one priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are actively working with our partners at all levels in the health care system and implementing enhanced and comprehensive measures to prevent the spread of this virus and protect the health of all Ontarians.""

This is a critical step to help address the increased daily call volumes and reduce call wait times. ""By immediately expanding Telehealth's resources, we can significantly reduce the time it takes for Ontarians to receive the information they need to stay safeand healthy,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are also initiating further discussions with our nursing partners to ensure there are Telehealth resources in place moving forward as COVID-19 continues to evolve. We will be ready for any scenario."" Phase 1: Immediately Increase Resources to Reduce Call Wait Times Yesterday,the province and Ontario Health started to deploy approximately 130 nurses to conduct symptom assessments and referrals among callers who request a callback. Nurses will work from existing regional offices to provide immediate support and respond to callers seeking a callback to help mitigate current wait times. To onboard these additional nursing resources, Telehealth has developed a specific training package for newly added nurses to expedite their ability to provide callback support immediately. Telehealth will also increase intake staff to reduce wait times for initial contact with a Telehealth representative. Telehealthhas been providing valuable support to the Ministry's Emergency Operations Centre (MEOC) since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak inmid-January. In February, Telehealth began to add additional resources to manage increased daily call volumes, including seven full-time Registered Nurses and 10 customer service representatives. Phase 2: Continue to Manage COVID-19 Call Volumes Whileimplementation of Phase 1 is currently underway, Ontario and Telehealthhave already begun planning rollout of Phase 2. To further increase intake and nursing capacity over the coming days and weeks, Ontario is actively working with the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) to identify support for Telehealth from its 44,000 registered nurse members. The province has also started to explore existing non-clinical resources within the Ontario Public Service and other broader public sector organizations to support Telehealth's call volumes. In order to be prepared to be nimble and effective in any scenario, Ontario is also exploring a partnership with organizationswhich have existing health care call centres to provide symptom assessment for COVID-19 to callers requesting a callback. ""We understand that people are anxious to get the advice about next steps assoon as possible, which is why the capacity of Telehealth is being enhanced,"" says Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health. ""But unless you are experiencing severe symptoms or a medical emergency, the best place for you to stay is at home until you receive advice, which will often be to stay home and self-monitor."" Inaddition to enhancing capacity at Telehealth, Ontario has approved new physician billing codes to enable doctors to continue to provide routinehealth care services by video and telephone, including assessment of possible COVID-19 symptoms. This will help keep patients at home rather than in their doctor's office where they would be in close contact with others. Ontario has also established dedicated assessment centresin areas experiencing significant growth in COVID-19 testing, with additional centres being established across the province in the coming weeks. Before visiting an assessment centre, individuals should first seek guidance on whether it is appropriate for them to do so. Ontarians can do so by using a new online self-assessment tool,calling Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 or calling their local public health unit. People should not go to an assessment centre unless they have symptoms of the COVID-19. Quick FactsTelehealth Ontario is a free, confidential, provincial service that provides 24/7 access to health advice and information from aRegistered Nurse to all Ontarians in 300 languages. During this COVID-19 outbreak, Telehealth triages callers, provides information, assessment and depending on symptoms will inform patients on how to self-isolate.To date, there have been more than 8,000 COVID-19 related calls.",

At the same time, we must also carefully consider how to best maximize resources and prioritize services.  After consultation with the Ontario Hospital Association, and with the support of Dr. DavidWilliams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, the province is requesting that all hospitals further implement pandemic plans by carefully ramping down elective surgeries and other non-emergent clinical activity. In doing so, hospitals can preserve capacity as casesof COVID-19 continue to grow in Ontario. As hospitals move forward with the implementation of their pandemic plans and decisions ontheir operations, we are asking them to follow three guiding principles: Use an ethical framework to guide decision-making;Prevent high risk and occult transmission; and Develop and preserve capacity within our system. Theapproach that we are taking will provide the necessary discretion for hospitals to make decisions based on local circumstances, while preserving the ability for the province to take a more prescriptive approach, should it be warranted based on evidence. Iwould once again like to thank all of Ontario's health care providers who are working tirelessly each day to ensure that the health and well-being of Ontarians is being protected.""",

""Ontario'spublic health system continues to demonstrate remarkable responsivenessto COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While we have so far effectively contained new cases of this virus, we are relentlessly focused on planning for any scenario. We are actively working with our partners at all levels in the health care system to implement enhanced measures to ensure that we are prepared to protect the health of all Ontarians."" Enhanced Access to Screening To rapidly expand screening and ease pressures on hospital emergency departments, Ontario will immediately establish a number of dedicated assessment centresin areas experiencing significant growth in testing. Some of the first wave of assessment centres will open in the next several days, includingat William Osler Health System - Peel Memorial site, The Ottawa Hospital, North York General Hospital, Mackenzie Health, Scarborough Health Network, and Trillium Health Partners. These centres are located in dedicated spaces that will facilitate high-quality care, to protect broader patient populations.  Additional assessment centres will be established across the province in the coming weeks. Regions without an assessment centre will continue to be serviced by their local hospital or primary care settings. Ontario has also approved new physician billing codesfor telephone assessments, enabling doctors to conduct more assessmentsover the phone rather than in their clinic, helping to keep patients athome rather than in primary care settings where they would co-mingle with others. In the coming days, the province will also launch a new COVID-19 self-assessment tool on its dedicated web page (Ontario.ca/coronavirus).This new tool will take the public through a series of questions to help inform those who are concerned about having contracted COVID-19 about how they can seek care based on their needs. Ontario is workingclosely with Telehealth to ensure adequate support to handle increased call volumes and is committed to allocating additional resources as needed to ensure timely responses for Ontarians. In addition tocontinuing to review virtual care capacity, including further expandingTelehealth and encouraging virtual care uptake, the Command Table has initiated early planning for the implementation of at-home testing, all of which will support caring for people at home. Expanding Lab-Testing Capacity Working with Public Health Ontario and Ontario Health, the province is working to enhance laboratory testing capacity across the province to rapidly mobilize, monitor and coordinate COVID-19 testing. Laboratorytesting is also being conducted on other respiratory samples from hospital emergency departments and long-term care homes in order to identify and quickly respond to any unknown cases of COVID-19. Protecting the Public and Frontline Workers Toensure Ontarians have access to credible and up-to-date information on how to maintain their health and the health of their families, Ontario has launched a provincewide public education campaign. The campaign, which includes search, social, print and radio ads on every-day steps Ontarians can take to keep themselves safe, is in addition to the resources available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus. This dedicated web page is now being updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week, with relevant information on any new cases and includes fact sheets translated in nearly 30 distinct languages. As the global and local situation evolves, the Command Table will continue to evaluate the latest evidence to provide ongoing guidance to the public and providers. Ontario has issued updated guidelines to long-term care homesto ensure active screening for all staff, volunteers, family members, as well as new and returning residents, and will do so for retirement homes shortly. Ontario will continue to update guidelines for other health care facilities in response to the evolving situation. In addition to these extensive planning measures, Ontario is providing stability to municipalities as they complete 2021 budget planning by committing to extending one-time mitigation funding for an additional calendar year forthe province's public health units. This action ensures that historicalmunicipal adjustments remain capped at 10 per cent, and recognizes the considerable time and resources necessary for public health units to effectively respond to COVID-19. Extending mitigation funding would keepmunicipal funding levels for public health units in calendar year 2021 at the same level as calendar year 2020.

In addition tocontinuing to review virtual care capacity, including further expandingTelehealth and encouraging virtual care uptake, the Command Table has initiated early planning for the implementation of at-home testing, all of which will support caring for people at home. Expanding Lab-Testing Capacity Working with Public Health Ontario and Ontario Health, the province is working to enhance laboratory testing capacity across the province to rapidly mobilize, monitor and coordinate COVID-19 testing. Laboratorytesting is also being conducted on other respiratory samples from hospital emergency departments and long-term care homes in order to identify and quickly respond to any unknown cases of COVID-19. Protecting the Public and Frontline Workers Toensure Ontarians have access to credible and up-to-date information on how to maintain their health and the health of their families, Ontario has launched a provincewide public education campaign. The campaign, which includes search, social, print and radio ads on every-day steps Ontarians can take to keep themselves safe, is in addition to the resources available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus. This dedicated web page is now being updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week, with relevant information on any new cases and includes fact sheets translated in nearly 30 distinct languages. As the global and local situation evolves, the Command Table will continue to evaluate the latest evidence to provide ongoing guidance to the public and providers. Ontario has issued updated guidelines to long-term care homesto ensure active screening for all staff, volunteers, family members, as well as new and returning residents, and will do so for retirement homes shortly. Ontario will continue to update guidelines for other health care facilities in response to the evolving situation. In addition to these extensive planning measures, Ontario is providing stability to municipalities as they complete 2021 budget planning by committing to extending one-time mitigation funding for an additional calendar year forthe province's public health units. This action ensures that historicalmunicipal adjustments remain capped at 10 per cent, and recognizes the considerable time and resources necessary for public health units to effectively respond to COVID-19. Extending mitigation funding would keepmunicipal funding levels for public health units in calendar year 2021 at the same level as calendar year 2020. This is in addition to the up to $100 million COVID-19 Contingency Fund announced yesterday.

""What we determined today is that this hiatus will be, most likely, at least 30 days,"" commissioner Adam Silver said while appearing on the NBA on TNT on Thursday. ""We don't know enough, as you've all said, to be more specific than that."" Nowthere will be no games at all, at least for the time being. A person with knowledge of the situation said the Jazz player who tested positivewas centre Rudy Gobert. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the team confirmedthe presumptive positive test. A second person with knowledge told AP on Thursday that Gobert's Utah teammate, Donovan Mitchell, tested positive as well. The test result, the NBA said, was reported shortly before the scheduled tip-off time for the Utah at Oklahoma City game on Wednesday night was called off. Players were on the floor for warmups when they were told to return to their locker rooms. About 30 minutes later, fans were told the game was postponed ""due to unforeseen circumstances."" WATCH | Thunder, Jazz game postponed: Players leave court after Jazz player tests positive for coronavirus18 days ago0:35The NBA has suspended itsseason ""until further notice"" after Utah Jazz player is diagnosed with COVID-19. Jazz-Thunder game stopped just before tip-off. 0:35 Thosecircumstances were the league's worst-case scenario for now — a player testing positive. A second person who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity said the league expects the shutdown to last a minimum of two weeks, but cautioned that timeframe is very fluid. The Utah Jazz hosted the Toronto Raptors in a 101-92 defeat on Monday. Gobertplayed a total of 32 minutes before he was ejected along with Toronto forward OG Anunoby after the pair engaged in an on-court altercation. Raptors overcome early Norman Powell exit to earn 4th consecutive winList of sporting events affected by the coronavirus pandemic Formost people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, which declared a pandemic onWednesday, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have beendiagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. CharlotteHornets coach James Borrego, speaking before his team played at Miami on Wednesday — where news of the shutdown broke during the fourth quarter — said ""these are scary times."" WATCH | Mark Cuban interviewed after league suspended: Mavericks owner Mark Cuban reacts to suspension of NBA season17 days ago3:02Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is interviewed during their game against the Denver Nuggets. This shortly after news broke that the NBA season would be suspended. 3:02 TheNational Hockey League released a statement saying it was aware of the NBA's decision to suspend its season and expects to provide a further update on Thursday. Earlier, the NCAA announced that the men's and women's Division I tournaments would be played without fans — exceptfor a few family members — permitted inside to watch. ""People are clearly taking the measures that they feel they need to take for safety,"" said Miami Heat guard Duncan Robinson, who played in both the Division I and Division III national championship games during his college days at Michigan and Williams. ""We love playing in frontof our fans and we feel like that gives us an advantage. But at the same time the NBA has to protect its players in the league and the fans,"" he said. Things have been trending toward empty arenas for some time. On Wednesday morning the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a U.S. Congressional committee that he would recommend the NBA not allow fans at games in response to the coronavirus. WATCH | NBA suspends season indefinitely amid COVID-19 concerns: NBA suspends season, Blue Jays' spring training update amid coronavirus pandemic17 days ago2:37The NBA announced they have indefinitely suspended the remainder of the regular season after itwas revealed one of their players tested positive for the coronavirus. Jamie Strashin also provides an update from Blue Jays' spring training and how they've been impacted by the virus. 2:37 ""We would recommend that there not be large crowds,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, responding to a question about the NBA's reaction. ""Ifthat means not having any people in the audience when the NBA plays, sobe it. But as a public health official, anything that has crowds is something that would give a risk to spread."" At the time of the league's announcement, the Dallas Mavericks' home game against the Denver Nuggets was midway through the third quarter. Two other games — the New York Knicks at the Atlanta Hawks and the Charlotte Hornets at the Miami Heat — were late in the fourth quarter. All three games were allowed to finish before the suspension took effect. Thelast game of the night's six-game slate, New Orleans at Sacramento, wascalled off as well because one of the referees assigned to work that Pelicans-Kings game, Courtney Kirkland, worked the Jazz-Raptors game on Monday.

Ontario recently announced that the province is implementing an enhancedresponse structure to COVID-19 that brings together a wide range of partners to strengthen and implement provincial and regional plans. Thestructure involves the creation of a number of tables - or expert teams- including a new Command Table that will serve as a single point of oversight. Senior leadership from across government and the health sector are now providing clear strategic direction to guide Ontario's ongoing response to COVID-19. Through a Collaboration Table, stakeholders from the long-term care sector have the opportunity to provide valuable advice. Our government has also recently instructed long-term care homes to begin active screening of staff, students, volunteers, visitors, residents moving into a long-term care home and residents returning to a long-term care home. These individualswill now be proactively checked for symptoms and asked about recent travel history and contacts. Outbreaks can occur in long-term care homes throughout the year and, as it is flu season, homes currentlyhave respiratory infection outbreak protocols in place. When long-term care homes submit samples for standard respiratory testing, they will now also be tested for COVID-19 automatically to ensure the province identifies potentially unknown cases. Ontario continues to work directly with our partners at the Public Health Agency of Canada and local public health units to monitor the situation closely. Newly strengthened protocols for identification and control are in place to keep the public safe. These protocols and processes continue to be effective and the risk to Ontarians taking precautions to keep themselves and their families safe remains low. There are everyday actions that residents, staff and family members should continue to taketo reduce exposure to the virus and help prevent the spread of germs: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer;sneeze and cough into your sleeve;avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth;avoid contact with people who are sick;stay home if you are sick; anddo not visit a long-term care home if you are feeling ill. Ontario'scommitment to the safety, quality of care and quality of life of long-term care home residents is safeguarded by regulations and requirements in the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007. Long-term care homes enforce rigorous provincial standards for all public health concerns, including outbreak management systems for detecting, managing,and controlling infectious disease outbreaks. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Long-Term Care are working together in close cooperation with our partners in both the long-term care and other health care sectors to ensure the continued safety and well-being of residents, families and staff.""

Today, I joined Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health for Canada, and my ministerial colleagues from each of the provinces and territories to share important information and further coordinate our joint efforts to protect the health and well being of all Canadians, including Ontarians, from the emerging issues of the Wuhan novel coronavirus. The federal government outlined their enhanced measures, which now include: Screening questions at border kiosks will now include questions about previous travel to Wuhan, China in the past 14 days. A positive response would trigger an enhanced screening process, including sending the traveller to a Canadian border agent for further questioning about their health status. The border agent will determine whether the traveller needs to seek immediate medical assessment and treatment and, if so, EMS will transport the traveller from the airport directly to hospital. This screening will be done in Vancouver and Montreal as well.Fact sheets are also being developed in English, French and Chinese for people who have travelled to China and are not currently exhibiting signs of illness. These fact sheets will outline the symptoms that individuals should watch for and any next steps should they experience symptoms, including seeking an immediate medical assessment. The federalgovernment's enhanced screening measures build on Ontario's robust and comprehensive protocols in place to actively monitor for, detect and contain any suspected cases of Wuhan novel coronavirus. The federal government's measures will further support my ministry, in collaborationwith Public Health Ontario, local health units, hospitals and health care providers, to monitor the Wuhan novel coronavirus and contain any cases, should one present in Ontario. While the risk to Ontariansremains low, we will continue to be in close contact with the Public Health Agency of Canada and other jurisdictions to monitor this developing situation and safeguard the health of all Ontarians.

The local public health unit can then quicklyand effectively take all necessary measures to investigate, complete lab tests, and do case and contact management to prevent and control further spread of the infection. Ontario's reporting requirements now align with British Columbia and Alberta. Given the recent media coverage, it is also important to note that Ontario's integrated health system today is far more prepared to respond to any potential health risks than in the past. We now have mechanisms in place, which have strengthened how health care providers work together and coordinate responses to emerging public health issues, such as this new virus. Significant investments in our public health and infection prevention and control systems have been made, including the creation of Public Health Ontario.

Anyone who has travelled outside Canada may have come in contact with the novel coronavirus and should closely monitor their health for 14 days after returning to the country. Travellers who start to feel unwell, should stay at home/self-isolate away from the public. Individuals who develop a fever, with a temperature 38°C or higher, and/or cough should call 811 for assessment.

To date, there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

To help protect older Nova Scotians and those most at risk for severe illness, the province is restricting visitors who have travelled outside the country in the last 14 days from entering long-term care homes. As always, anyone who is feeling unwell should not enter a facility.

“We are expanding our screening to include travel outside of the country as the virus continues to spread,” said Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health. “With more cases expected in Canada and spread into the community likely, we are adapting our processes to respond to this rapidly evolving situation.”
To prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, it is important that all Nova Scotians:
practise good handwashing hygiene
use cough and sneeze etiquette
avoid touching your face
minimize close face-to-face contact with people who appear ill
stay away from others if you feel unwell
regularly clean and disinfect high touch surfaces

An intermittent sentence is ordered by a court and allows a person to serve a sentence in small blocks of time – usually on weekends - instead of all at once.

The person serving the sentence continues to live at home and work in the community most of the time so they can work and fulfill family obligations. Under the Criminal Code, a judge can impose an intermittent sentence if the term of imprisonment is 90 days or less.

This health protection measure is being made with the guidance and advice of public health officials. This measure is allowed under the Nova Scotia Correctional Services Act, and is in effect until further notice.

Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Keith Colwell is meeting regularly with the ministers responsible for fisheries and aquaculture in the other Atlantic provinces and Quebec to discuss ways to support the seafood industry during the COVID-19 crisis.

The province announced one measure in support of Nova Scotia’s fishery sector today, March 20, that it is deferring payments and interest for government lending programs until June 30. This includes loans under the Fisheries and Aquaculture Loan Board.

The five provincial ministers have begun weekly discussions to share ideas and discuss developments and options. Today, the ministers also had a joint call with federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Bernadette Jordan.

“Nova Scotia’s ongoing collaboration with Minister Jordan and the federal government, and our strong working relationship with the other Atlantic provinces and Quebec benefit the commercial fishery in our region. I look forward to our continued co-operation in the future as we gather information from our local industry and hear their concerns during this difficult time coping with COVID-19. By communicating and working closely together and with the federal department, we can better help our fishing industries meet today’s challenges, “said Mr. Colwell.

In their call this week, the ministers discussed the importance of the fishing and aquaculture sector to their individual provinces, the importance of food supply, and their desire to work together with their respective industries to minimize the impact of COVID-19 as much as possible, to ensure people remain safe. They agreed to work collectively with the federal government on ways to lessen impacts.

Quotes:
The public health measures put in place to combat the COVID-19 pandemic have created a unique situation with both economic and social consequences for our seafood industry and or coastal communities. Unique solutions will be required, but working together as a region provides an advantage for all of Atlantic Canada’s seafood producers. The health of our citizens is top priority but we are also committed to helping this vital industry remain strong.
Prince Edward Island Minister of Fisheries and Communities Jamie Fox

It is imperative that we work together to support Atlantic Canada’s seafood industry in these difficult times. Our harvesters, aquaculture producers and seafood processors have always been ready to adapt to make sure they maintain their livelihood for current and future generations, and this is no exception. We will continue to focus efforts to support this resilient industry and to ensure it remains a sustainable way of life for rural, coastal and Aboriginal communities.
New Brunswick Minister of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries Ross Wetmore

As the pandemic’s impact on the Atlantic region’s seafood sector evolves, I will continue to work in close collaboration with my Atlantic colleagues to secure the necessary strategies and supports that ensure our respective fishing industries correctly respond and ultimately recover.

The cases are located across the province. The 21 individuals affected range in age from late-teens to mid-70’s.

Public health has been in contact with these individuals and are working to identify others who may have come in close contact with them. Those individuals are also being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.

“This is an unprecedented time for all of us and I want to thank Nova Scotians for their cooperation given the disruption to all of our daily lives,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “If we follow public health advice, support our neighbors, friends and family, and do our part, we will slow the spread of this virus in our province.”
The province is testing daily, working with partners at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. To date, Nova Scotia has 1,826 negative test results, 12 presumptive positive cases and nine confirmed cases.

“This is just the beginning for Nova Scotia and we all need to stay vigilant, practise good hygiene and social distancing, and self-isolate for 14 days if you have travelled outside Canada or are feeling unwell,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “The prevention measures we’ve put in place can work and there is still time for our actions to influence the impact that COVID-19 has on Nova Scotia.”

Nova Scotians should not leave the province and only leave home for essential items and services.

A state of emergency gives government broad powers to do whatever is necessary for the safety and protection of Nova Scotians.

“These decisions were not made lightly and should signal to Nova Scotians the seriousness of what’s before us,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “These orders may seem harsh but they are absolutely necessary. We all have a moral and legal obligation to obey if we want to bring the spread of COVID-19 under control.”

Nova Scotians should not leave the province and only leave home for essential items and services.

A state of emergency gives government broad powers to do whatever is necessary for the safety and protection of Nova Scotians.

“These decisions were not made lightly and should signal to Nova Scotians the seriousness of what’s before us,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “These orders may seem harsh but they are absolutely necessary. We all have a moral and legal obligation to obey if we want to bring the spread of COVID-19 under control.”
Under the state of emergency:
Nova Scotia borders will tighten to travellers and all entry points (land, sea, air) will be closely managed starting Monday, March 23, at 6 a.m., Nova Scotians should only leave if essential.

“Keeping Nova Scotians safe and healthy is our number one job. Everything we are doing, we are doing to keep you safe,” said Premier McNeil. “We all need to keep working together, support one another and make sure we are following the public health advice. That is the only way we can control the spread of this virus.”
Measures announced today include:
increased testing for COVID-19 -- public health officials have begun testing all close contacts of positive cases
lab capacity is doubling to accommodate increased testing
expanding virtual care for physicians, nurse practitioners and others so they can offer appointments to patients through telephone or video, minimizing the need to leave the house; more than 80 providers have signed up for video so far
811 has increased staff and technology and is now answering 50 per cent more calls; on April 3, 811 will again double its capacity
enhanced infection control measures at hospitals to protect health-care workers and the public include reassigning and adding new staff to increase the frequency of cleaning and disinfection; focusing on high-risk areas and high-traffic areas and high-touch surfaces; using stronger cleaning products
regulated health professions can only stay open for emergency or urgent cases or to provide virtual care (excluding doctors, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, nurses and paramedics) as long as they can meet social distancing requirements in their waiting room or other non-clinical areas and follow the cleaning protocol
non-regulated health professions (such as naturopaths) must close. One exception is podiatrists who must follow the directive related to regulated health professions
Access Centres and Registry of Motor Vehicle Offices will start to resume operations in a scaled back, limited contact business model. Staff working out of Access Centres and Registry of Motor Vehicle offices in Amherst, Bridgewater, Dartmouth, Kentville, Stellarton, Sydney and Yarmouth will be available to help people with urgent matters by calling 1-800-670-4357. In addition, government has extended deadlines for more vehicle permits, registrations and renewals until Aug.31. Drop-off boxes for applicable services will also be available at Access Centres in Amherst, Bridgewater, Dartmouth, Kentville, Stellarton, Sydney and Yarmouth. Many of the services are also available online.
Essential service sectors in Nova Scotia, which are exempt from the five-person-or-fewer gathering rules, have been clarified and are:
health
food, agri-food and fisheries
transportation, including trucking, rail and transit
construction and manufacturing
IT, telecommunications and critical infrastructure
public services, such as police, fire and ambulances
Individual business in these sectors must still maintain social distancing and other public health protocols.

“We need your help to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” said Dr. Strang. “It is critically important to wash your hands, practise social distancing and self-isolate if you need to. It’s also important to be truthful in your interactions with health-care workers and don’t call 911 unless you have an emergency. Working together we can protect our communities and our most vulnerable citizens.”

“Our health-care system is being examined from top to bottom to ensure we are ready for COVID-19,” said Premier McNeil. “Our hospital administrators, our doctors and nurses, cleaning staff – everyone is focused on containing the spread. But none of this matters if you don’t stay at home and avoid social gatherings.”
Dr. Strang said testing to confirm COVID-19 is being expanded to include:
anyone referred by 811 to an assessment centre
all close contacts of people who test positive
people in hospital that meet the criteria for testing
An alternate phone line has been set up to ensure health-care workers are virus-free, able to safely provide care and not burden the 811 system. The service deals with NSHA and IWK staff, home-care and long-term care providers, pharmacists and health providers in First Nations communities.

“Over the next two weeks as travellers come home, we need to control and limit spread of this virus,” said Dr. Strang. “We can do this by strictly following public health measures – physical distancing and self-isolation.”
Other measures announced today include:
reservations for the 2020 camping season are on hold; an announcement will made when they are available
open fires are banned for any purpose in woods or within 305 metres of woods in any part of the province and will be in effect until May 15 (the public can report wildfires by calling 911 in an emergency or by calling 1-800-565-2224)

Seventeen new cases were identified Thursday, March 26. Most are connected to travel or a known case. None of the new cases are connected to the St. Patrick’s Day gathering in Lake Echo, Halifax Regional Municipality. All attendees at the event are being contacted and are being tested. Case investigations are ongoing. At this point, public health cannot confirm a link to community spread.

It is imperative that anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia self-isolate for 14 days and for everyone to adhere to the five-person social gathering limit. As always, any Nova Scotian who develops symptoms of acute respiratory illness should limit their contact with others until they feel better. If they are concerned about COVID-19 they can go to https://811.novascotia.ca/ and use the online assessment tool. Anyone referred to an assessment site by 811 will be tested.

The 90 individuals affected range in age from under ten to mid-70's. Two individuals are currently in hospital. Three individuals have recovered and their cases of COVID-19 are considered resolved. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province.

Public health is working to identify people who may have come in close contact with the confirmed cases. Those individuals who have been confirmed are being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.

To date, Nova Scotia has 3,649 negative test results and 90 confirmed cases.

If you have travelled outside of Nova Scotia or been in close contact with someone who has travelled and are experiencing fever or new cough you should complete the online questionnaire before calling 811. The online questionnaire can be found at: https://811.novascotia.ca/

An outbreak of COVID-19, novel coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness, first identified in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China continues to spread to other countries, including Canada and the United States. As of today, New Brunswick continues to have no confirmed cases, but we cannot be complacent. We need to take the appropriate precautions to lower the risk to all of us.

I know many people have already left or will be travelling outside of New Brunswick for the March break. For those travelling, the Public Health Agency of Canada is regularly posting travel notices. In addition, all travellers who are returning to New Brunswick, no matter where they were in the world, need to monitor themselves and their loved ones closely for symptoms, which include a fever, a cough and difficulty breathing. Anyone with those symptoms should call Tele-Care at 8-1-1 before going to a hospital or doctor’s office so that the proper precautions can be taken to reduce further spread of the disease.

All of us can also take simple actions that can help stop the spread of any type of communicable disease. Regular hand washing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and staying home when you are sick can greatly reduce the risk of infection spreading.

I want to assure New Brunswickers that our government officials are conducting emergency planning so that we are communicating, planning and co-ordinating with first responders, our communities and individual New Brunswickers to ensure we are ready.

I am personally having daily briefings with Public Health and Emergency Measures Organization leaders to receive any pertinent updates on the situation and our preparedness plans. Recognizing that this disease knows no borders, I have also written to Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, the chair of the Council of the Federation which represents all premiers across the country. The goal is to ensure that good information is shared nationally about how our response plans will work, and what Canadians need to do to be ready.

I know that information has and will continue to come from a number of sources. It is important that people only count on the information from trusted sources to direct what they should do. In that regard, as the situation continues to evolve, information will be continuously provided and updated at gnb.ca/coronavirus, on the Government of New Brunswick social media channels, through traditional media and other methods as required.

We all need to heed the advice of our professionals who are working diligently to ensure we are prepared and any impact is minimal. I thank them for their efforts and I have let them know that I will provide whatever support is required.",

All New Brunswickers have a role to play to prevent the spread of respiratory infection by taking simple actions including washing your hands frequently, covering your cough and sneezes, and staying home when sick.

We are asking all travellers who are returning to New Brunswick from outside the country, no matter where they were in the world, to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms for 14 days.

Symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing may take up to 14 days to appear. Should an individual who has recently traveled outside the country experience these symptoms, they should:

isolate themselves from others as quickly as possible;
immediately call 811 or their health-care provider;
describe their symptoms and travel history; and
follow instructions carefully.
There are several ways that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could affect the province but the provincial government is committed to being prepared for any eventuality. The province has been planning for a flu pandemic for several years, and it has a comprehensive system in place to address a pandemic situation.

Preparations are being carried out in collaboration with other provincial and territorial public health agencies and the Public Health Agency of Canada, which is working with its international partners.

The Department of Health is continuing to work closely with its partners and continues to issue public updates as they become available.

It is recommended that people with influenza-like symptoms limit contact with other people, including other household members, until they are free of symptoms and are feeling well.

It is important for New Brunswickers to understand that if they do not have influenza-like symptoms it is safe to go to work and school, to participate in activities, and to socialize, unless they were directed otherwise on their return from being outside the country.",

Anyone who has traveled internationally in the past 14 days should monitor themselves for 14 days from when they arrived back in Canada. Individual risk will vary depending upon the destination. People arriving from Iran or the Chinese province of Hubei will need to isolate themselves regardless of symptoms.

Older adults and people who have certain chronic medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart and lung disease are more likely to contract the novel coronavirus and to experience more severe symptoms.

This particular group should plan to start minimizing attendance at crowded gatherings and mass events or think of other ways of participating (i.e. virtual attendance). Stay in touch with others through phone, email or text. This group should think about what health and food supplies they need on hand should they have to stay home, and slowly start replenishing their shelves with non-perishable, easy-to-prepare foods like dried pasta and sauce and canned soup, vegetables and beans. Also consider seeing your health-care provider or pharmacist to renew your prescriptions ahead of time.

We are very concerned about keeping this infection out of nursing homes, seniors’ residences, and other locations where vulnerable people gather. If you are a staff member, family member, or friend and you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, please avoid nursing and other care homes, senior’s residences, and assisted living facilities.

All New Brunswickers have a role to play in preventing the spread of respiratory infection by taking simple actions such as washing your hands frequently, covering your coughs and sneezes and staying home when sick.

Symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing may take up to 14 days to appear. Should an individual who has recently traveled outside the country experience non-specific symptoms (such as headache, congestion, achiness, feeling unwell) they should separate themselves from others and stay home to monitor themselves.

Should these symptoms progress to include fever or cough, the individual should:

immediately call 811;
describe their symptoms and travel history; and
follow any instructions carefully.
Continue to take important everyday precautions such as washing your hands often and avoiding touching common surfaces in public places.

She also noted that all the people who came in contact with the woman have been self-isolating.

To address public anxiety in the wake of the first confirmed case, Russell said that she’s strongly encouraging non-essential activities and events of 100 people or more to be suspended.

She recommends that people avoid shaking hands, maintain proper hygiene, keep a six-foot distance from people and avoid buffet-style eating, and for event gatherers to safely isolate those who become ill on site.

“It’s about minimizing close contact. Most of the cases are travel-related, and [have been transmitted] within six feet and two metres,” Russell said.
Horizon Health Network has also announced an update to minimize close contact. It stated in a tweet that anyone who has traveled outside the country is restricted from visiting any patient in their facilities for 14 days after returning to Canada.

Canada has now surpassed 100 cases of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, according to tallies from the provinces.

As of Thursday, Johns Hopkins CSSE said there were more than 127,500 confirmed cases worldwide. There have been more than 4,700 deaths.

Russell said that the case relates to a woman between the ages of 50 and 60 who had travelled from France.

“The person was self-monitoring, then immediately self-isolated when she developed symptoms and called 811,” said Russell.",

Everyone has a role to play in mitigating the impact of COVID-19. It takes more than governments and action from the health sector to protect the health and safety of New Brunswickers.

Social distancing measures are a way to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the community. This means minimizing close contact with others during the peak of an outbreak. In addition to staying home when ill, New Brunswickers should plan actions they can take to reduce the spread of infection in places where people gather.

Some social distancing measures need extensive preparation, especially those with large crowds.

At this time, in an abundance of caution and to address public anxiety, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health recommends that any non-essential mass gathering (150 or more people) be cancelled or postponed until we are able to better determine the risk to our population. We understand that such a measure will disrupt the normal activities of our residents but believe it the prudent path to ensuring that we delay and minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our population. We are also encouraging amateur sports leagues or social gathering activities like dance or theatre to consider suspending their non-essential activities.

Mass gatherings can have the potential for serious public health consequences if they are not planned and managed carefully. They can increase the spread of infectious diseases and cause additional strain on the health-care system when held during outbreaks.

Infections can also be transmitted during transit to and from an event, and in the homes of event participants upon their return.

Event planners need to consider the COVID-19 outbreak.

Aside from cancelling or postponing an event, other measures to reduce infection risks during smaller mass gatherings include:

avoiding shaking hands;
practising proper hygiene;
avoiding common sleeping areas;
discouraging attendees from sharing food or drinks;
increasing social distance between others (ideally to two metres) by:
broadcasting events
offering virtual participation
moving the venue from indoors to outdoors
eliminating self-serve buffet style eating at social or religious gatherings;
encouraging people who are ill or those with high-risk medical conditions not to attend gatherings;
supporting hand hygiene by providing hand sanitizer dispensers in prominent locations;
ensuring event organizers have arrangements in place to safely isolate and transport people who become ill onsite; and
communicating clearly to attendees about the risks and directing them to our advice on reducing the spread of illness.
For more information, refer to Public Health Agency of Canada’s COVID-19 guidance on risk-informed decision making for mass gatherings, available online.",

The health and well-being of New Brunswickers is our top priority.

Public Health would support a government decision to close schools in New Brunswick for two weeks in response to COVID-19. While we recognize the significant impact such a decision would have on families, students, schools and the entire community, this measure would help keep our residents safe.

People may still be travelling and, as the spread of COVID-19 is continuing to escalate internationally, additional measures should be considered.

Such measures should not extend to operators, staff or youth within early learning and childcare facilities at this time. The current risk assessment indicates that the risk of children acquiring COVID-19 is very low and the risk of them having serious disease outcomes is even lower. Early learning and childcare facilities operating within schools should also remain open at this time.

Daycares should screen for the virus by asking parents if their child is unwell and if they have travelled in the last 14 days.

Early learning and childcare facilities operators and staff who have travelled outside the country are asked to monitor themselves for symptoms for 14 days after they have returned to Canada.

Operators can access information online to guide them in implementing appropriate measures within their facilities.

Like our health-care workers, the role of early learning and child-care providers is a crucial one and I recognize their contribution to ensuring that essential services can continue to be provided to New Brunswick families.",

Public Health is also asking restaurant owners to limit the number of customers to 50 per cent of the capacity of their dining areas. Take-out orders, deliveries and drive-through services are permitted.

“It is imperative that everyone keep a distance of two metres (six feet) between themselves and others at all times,” said Russell. “Everyone must practise social distancing in all their interactions with neighbours, co-workers and fellow residents.”

Russell said there is one additional presumptive case of COVID-19 in the province, bringing the number of presumptive or positive cases in New Brunswick to seven.

The new case is a female, between 20 and 30 years old in Zone 2 (in the southern part of the province). The patient was screened, her recent travel history to Greece was confirmed and the patient was treated, tested and is in self-isolation.

Diagnostic testing confirmed the case as presumptive. Additional testing to confirm the case as a positive COVID-19 case will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

“Active contact tracing is being conducted by regional public health officials. These individuals are already isolating, and Public Health officials have already taken swift action to implement effective precautions to prevent the infection from spreading,” said Russell.

The regional health authorities will be opening community assessment centres to allow those who have been identified as high risk to be tested, without going to an Emergency Department.

Individuals who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms will be directed to the assessment centres by Tele-Care 811. Once the individual has been assessed by Tele-Care, and if they require an in-person assessment, a referral will be provided to the Community Assessment Centre in their area.

It is important to note that these centres are not walk-in clinics. They are appointment based and all appointments are made through Tele-Care 811.

“It is imperative that everyone keep a distance of two metres (six feet) between themselves and others at all times,” said Russell. “Everyone must practise social distancing in all their interactions with neighbours, co-workers and fellow residents.”

Russell said there is one additional presumptive case of COVID-19 in the province, bringing the number of presumptive or positive cases in New Brunswick to seven.

The new case is a female, between 20 and 30 years old in Zone 2 (in the southern part of the province). The patient was screened, her recent travel history to Greece was confirmed and the patient was treated, tested and is in self-isolation.

Diagnostic testing confirmed the case as presumptive. Additional testing to confirm the case as a positive COVID-19 case will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

“Active contact tracing is being conducted by regional public health officials. These individuals are already isolating, and Public Health officials have already taken swift action to implement effective precautions to prevent the infection from spreading,” said Russell.

The regional health authorities will be opening community assessment centres to allow those who have been identified as high risk to be tested, without going to an Emergency Department.

Individuals who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms will be directed to the assessment centres by Tele-Care 811. Once the individual has been assessed by Tele-Care, and if they require an in-person assessment, a referral will be provided to the Community Assessment Centre in their area.

It is important to note that these centres are not walk-in clinics. They are appointment based and all appointments are made through Tele-Care 811.

In an effort to allow 811 health-care professionals to support more people who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, the Department of Health has authorized physicians to see their patients “virtually” for routine services such as prescription renewals and providing follow-up health advice.

These people will be moved into a nursing home that provides services in their language of choice within 100 kilometres of their permanent address. Doing this will enhance the well-being of seniors who require 24-hour nursing care while freeing up dozens of hospital beds. This will allow for more capacity in our health-care system to address the needs of people facing serious illness.

Legislature

Today, the legislative assembly sat with a quorum of 15 members. All the parties worked together to pass numerous pieces of legislation, including the legislation to postpone the municipal elections planned for May. This legislation will also make it possible to postpone the provincial byelections if that becomes necessary. A decision was also made today that the house is going to rise until further notice.

Some businesses have had to temporarily close to help slow the spread of the virus, but Higgs reassured New Brunswickers that grocery stores and pharmacies have access to supplies and will stay open.

“It is critical that everyone do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Russell. “This can and will save lives.”

With our province under a state of emergency, I am imploring people to continue to take this situation seriously.”

Effective immediately, and for the duration of the emergency, patients with drug coverage under New Brunswick’s public drug plans will only be responsible for the initial co-payment on a prescription fill or refill. For example, a patient with a 90-day prescription will only have a co-payment for the first 30-day fill.

Testing has identified six new presumptive cases and confirmed two previous presumptive cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in New Brunswick to 17: eight confirmed and nine presumptive. There have been 771 tests administered to date in the province.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, continues to urge people to stay home, maintain social distance and wash their hands frequently.

“It is critical that everyone do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Russell. “This can and will save lives.”

Premier Blaine Higgs acknowledged that the increase in cases is not surprising.

“Based on what we have seen in other jurisdictions, we know that the numbers will continue to rise,” said Higgs. “We have put measures in place here in New Brunswick to try to slow down the rising number of cases. With our province under a state of emergency, I am imploring people to continue to take this situation seriously.”

The six new cases are:

a male, between 40 and 50, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise;
a female, between 50 and 60 in zone 3 (central), who is a direct contact of a previously identified presumptive case;
a female, between 40 and 50, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise;
a male, between 60 and 70, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise;
a female, between 50 and 60, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise; and
a female, between 20 and 30, in zone 2 (south), who is a close contact to a travel-related presumptive case.
Additional testing to confirm the cases will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

A new online self-assessment tool is now in use and Russell is pleased with the public response.

“Yesterday, almost 5,500 individuals used the self-assessment tool,” said Russell. “This has led to a reduction in the number of calls to the 811 line, which has allowed our health-care professionals to assist callers more promptly.”

Effective immediately, and for the duration of the emergency, patients with drug coverage under New Brunswick’s public drug plans will only be responsible for the initial co-payment on a prescription fill or refill. For example, a patient with a 90-day prescription will only have a co-payment for the first 30-day fill. There will be no co-payment required for the second and third 30-day fills on the same 90-day prescription. This applies to all New Brunswickers that are on the public drug plan, including many seniors and low-income individuals.

Among the steps being taken to address the pandemic is closing off non-essential travel between Canada and the United States, effective today.

“I want New Brunswickers to know government is doing its part to make sure returning travellers know what is expected of them,” said Higgs.

The premier added that travellers with symptoms are not being allowed to board airplanes. Everyone who arrives, by air or by land, is being screened at the border. If they have symptoms, they will be separated from others and Public Health will conduct isolation and testing. If they do not have symptoms, they will receive detailed information on what is expected of them. As well, all travellers must isolate themselves for 14 days after returning home. Anyone transporting these travellers from the airport, or those who mingle with them in other ways, must also self-isolate.

Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified 12 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 45. In addition, one of the individuals previously confirmed as a case of COVID-19, has now recovered.

The new cases include one which is being investigated as an incident of community transmission, which means the case cannot be directly traced back to an infection that occurred outside the province.

The new cases are:

An individual aged 60-69, in Zone 1 (southeast)
An individual aged 70-79, in Zone 1 (southeast)
An individual aged 70-79, in Zone 1 (southeast)
An individual aged 30-39, in Zone 1 (southeast)

Public Health has identified one confirmed COVID-19 case on each of two flights that came into New Brunswick; Air Canada Flight 8900 from Montreal to Moncton on March 16, and Sunwing Flight 169 from Punta Cana to Fredericton on March 18.

All passengers on those flights should already be self-isolating. However, it remains vital that people on those flights continue to remain in self-isolation for at least 14 days.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that with a case of potential community transmission now under investigation, changes will be made to the testing protocols.

“We are expanding testing to cover our health-care workers who have not travelled but have developed a new cough, fever or shortness of breath,” said Russell. “All workers in our health-care sector who have developed COVID-19 symptoms are directed to immediately self-isolate. This includes employees of regional health authorities, long-term care facilities, the Extra-Mural Hospital, Ambulance New Brunswick, community physicians and pharmacists.”

Information on the toll-free number for health-care employees to seek assistance will be available Saturday.

As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Canada, Premier Blaine Higgs said the need for co-operation between the federal government and the provinces has never been greater.

“We are already starting to discuss our country’s eventual recovery from this pandemic,” said Higgs. “Eventually, this situation will end, and as a nation, we will need to make the right decisions to grow our economy, repair the damage that has been done, and put us on a trajectory that will bring prosperity to Canada, including to the resilient people of New Brunswick.”

The Red Cross will have a website online at noon on Monday, March 30, that will provide information about a one-time income benefit available to either workers or self-employed people in New Brunswick who have lost their job due to the state of emergency.

Payments of this one-time $900 benefit will begin on April 2.

“I thank the Red Cross for their response and support,” said Higgs. “This is exactly the type of partnership we need during these difficult times.”

Playgrounds

Because of the pandemic, all school playgrounds and playgrounds associated with public housing facilities, are closed to support physical distancing requirements.

Businesses

Employers are reminded of their duty to comply with the measures in the state of emergency declaration. For the safety of employees and customers, businesses that are allowed to be open must limit the number of customers on their premises to maintain physical distancing rules and must check that customers entering are not among those required to be in self-isolation. Failing to comply could result in enforcement by the Department of Public Safety or a stop-work order by WorkSafeNB.

“I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important it is to continue to follow the guidelines regarding physical distancing, remaining at home and frequent hand-washing,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “These practices will save lives.”

Russell announced on March 27 that the province has revised its testing protocols to protect health-care workers and to help slow the pace of transmission. Workers who have direct contact with patients and who have developed COVID-19 symptoms since March 20, are directed to immediately self-isolate. This includes employees of regional health authorities, long-term care facilities, the Extra-Mural program, First Nation communities; Ambulance New Brunswick, community physicians and pharmacists.

Health-care workers who are self-employed or employed by other organizations and who have developed COVID-19 symptoms since March 20, are also directed to immediately self-isolate.

Unless directed otherwise by their employer, workers in the health-care sector may call 1-833-475-0724 if they have developed the following symptoms:

fever with a temperature of 38°C or higher;
a new or worsening cough;
shortness of breath.
Employees who are not in the health-care field should follow their normal processes for reporting absences to their managers due to illness. They should not call the toll-free number designated for health-care workers. The toll-free line is also not for employees who have questions regarding pay, entitlements, or other concerns.

In view of the good weather this weekend, Russell suggested people enjoy the outdoors while practising physical distancing.

Food production

Agriculture, aquaculture, fishing and processing operations are essential services and are permitted to continue; however, workplaces must take measures to limit the spread of COVID-19.

“I thank New Brunswick’s farmers, harvesters, aquaculturists and processors for their dedication in providing high-quality and safe products to families across the province in these critical times,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “They play an important role in keeping New Brunswickers healthy. We will continue to work with these sectors to address challenges as they arise.”

In addition to operating loans for small businesses announced by the provincial government, the federal government announced earlier this week that it has enhanced Farm Credit Canada’s lending capacity by an additional $5 billion to ensure producers, agribusinesses and food processors continue to have access to capital. Businesses facing financial pressure may call 1-888-332-3301 to discuss their situation and options.

“While I understand this is an unusual and challenging time for our province, my recommendations have not changed,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “We must continue to protect ourselves with frequent hand-washing and by remaining at home. Only go out for essential services like buying food, getting prescriptions, or attending medical appointments, and return home immediately after. It is important to continue to practice physical distancing. These practices will save lives.”

New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit

As announced on March 24, workers or self-employed people in New Brunswick who have lost their job due to the COVID-19 situation are eligible to receive a one-time income benefit of $900.

Applications will be available online starting at noon on Monday, March 30.

“We understand these are difficult times for all of us, and especially for our workers and their families,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “We are facing a situation unlike anything we have ever experienced. We believe this one-time benefit will help workers and self-employed people with their immediate needs and will keep us on a trajectory that will bring prosperity back to New Brunswick.”

The benefit is intended to help to bridge the time between when people lose their employment or close their business to when they receive their federal benefit.

To be eligible for the $900 benefit, a person must:

have lost his or her job.
have been laid off, or be self-employed and have lost all revenue, on or after March 15 due to the state of emergency in New Brunswick.
have earned a minimum of $5,000 (gross) in the last 12 months or in the last calendar year.

have no other income.
be 18 years or older.
More information on the benefit and the application procedure is available online.

“Since this benefit will be administered through the Red Cross, I want to personally thank the organization for its quick response and support,” said Higgs. “This is exactly the type of partnership we need during difficult times. It shows how strong we are as a province.”

March 20 – 10 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.
Anyone who was in those stores during those times should self-monitor and call 811 if they have any symptoms.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province’s chief medical officer of health, confirmed that incidents of community transmission are now present in New Brunswick; these are cases that cannot be directly traced back to an infection which took place outside the province. There are confirmed cases of community transmission in zones 1 (Moncton region), 2 (Saint John region) and 4 (Edmundston region). There are additional cases being investigated in other regions.

“This follows the trend we have seen in other parts of Canada. We have been expecting this and preparing for it,” said Russell. “People everywhere in New Brunswick have to act as if the virus is in their community whether it is confirmed or not.”

Russell said the potential for community transmission was the reason the province took proactive measures, such as directing people to stay at home, asking people to maintain physical distancing with others, limiting travel, and cancelling events where crowds may gather. These actions will limit the spread of the virus and the disease it carries, said Russell.

With community transmission now a reality, Russell said further changes are being made to the province’s testing protocols to ensure protection for those in greatest need. Testing will now focus on:

symptomatic health-care workers and staff of long-term care facilities and prisons
hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms and no alternative diagnosis
residents of long-term care facilities and other vulnerable communities
Symptomatic travellers from outside New Brunswick will continue to be tested.

Russell emphasized the continued importance of New Brunswickers being on alert for COVID-19 symptoms – a new or exacerbation of a chronic cough or a fever – among themselves and their families. People should use the self-assessment tool at the www.gnb.ca website for guidance and contact 811 if they have symptoms.

“If you have the symptoms of COVID-19, you must act as if you have COVID-19,” said Russell. “That means isolating yourself immediately for at least 14 days. Do not put others at risk by behaving as if you do not have this disease.

“More than ever, what you do matters. What each of us does matters. It remains within our capability to slow the progress and limit the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak.”

Entering the third week of emergency

Premier Blaine Higgs thanked all New Brunswickers for their quick action and innovation to address the pandemic.

Higgs said the government made difficult decisions early to flatten the curve and reduce the spread of COVID-19 by closing schools, government offices, businesses and all non-essential services. Higgs said he anticipates these decisions will have a positive effect in the days and weeks ahead.   

“Taking action before we were experiencing the full impact of the pandemic may have seemed extreme at the time, but I am confident it was the right thing to do,” said Higgs.  “We took these actions earlier than some jurisdictions because we saw what happened all around the world in places that waited too long to react.”

Emphasis on physical distancing

New Brunswickers are being reminded of the importance of physical distancing and self-isolation, particularly following stories in the media over the past week about people engaging in unacceptable behaviour that puts residents, essential workers and first responders in danger.

“The more successful we are at flattening the curve now, the quicker we can all get back to our regular lives,” said Higgs. “Many people and businesses have taken this situation seriously from the beginning, and they have done their part to help keep us all safe. We have to continue to do our part by staying at home and maintaining physical distance from others. There are still people disobeying the emergency order and putting us all at risk.”

New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit

Applications are now available for the $900 income benefit for workers or self-employed people in New Brunswick who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 situation.

Applications may be completed online or by calling the Red Cross at 1-800-863-6582 (toll free) from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week.

“Taking action before we were experiencing the full impact of the pandemic may have seemed extreme at the time, but I am confident it was the right thing to do,” said Higgs.  “We took these actions earlier than some jurisdictions because we saw what happened all around the world in places that waited too long to react.”

Emphasis on physical distancing

New Brunswickers are being reminded of the importance of physical distancing and self-isolation, particularly following stories in the media over the past week about people engaging in unacceptable behaviour that puts residents, essential workers and first responders in danger.

“The more successful we are at flattening the curve now, the quicker we can all get back to our regular lives,” said Higgs. “Many people and businesses have taken this situation seriously from the beginning, and they have done their part to help keep us all safe. We have to continue to do our part by staying at home and maintaining physical distance from others. There are still people disobeying the emergency order and putting us all at risk.”

Two new cases have been confirmed, bringing the total number of cases to 68; two of those people have since fully recovered. The new confirmed cases are:

an individual aged 30-40 in Zone 2 (Saint John region)
an individual aged 60-70 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)
Public Health is advising people who visited Shoppers Drug Mart at 175 Old Hampton Rd. in Quispamsis on the dates below that they were potentially exposed to COVID-19:

March 18 – 3:30 p.m. to midnight
March 19 – 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
March 26 – 8:15 a.m. to 11:45 a.m.
In addition, individuals who visited Shoppers Drug Mart at 57 Lansdowne Ave. in Saint John on the date below were potentially exposed to COVID-19:

March 20 – 10 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.
Anyone who was in those stores during those times should self-monitor and call 811 if they have any symptoms.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province’s chief medical officer of health, confirmed that incidents of community transmission are now present in New Brunswick; these are cases that cannot be directly traced back to an infection which took place outside the province. There are confirmed cases of community transmission in zones 1 (Moncton region), 2 (Saint John region) and 4 (Edmundston region). There are additional cases being investigated in other regions.

“This follows the trend we have seen in other parts of Canada. We have been expecting this and preparing for it,” said Russell. “People everywhere in New Brunswick have to act as if the virus is in their community whether it is confirmed or not.”

Russell said the potential for community transmission was the reason the province took proactive measures, such as directing people to stay at home, asking people to maintain physical distancing with others, limiting travel, and cancelling events where crowds may gather. These actions will limit the spread of the virus and the disease it carries, said Russell.

With community transmission now a reality, Russell said further changes are being made to the province’s testing protocols to ensure protection for those in greatest need. Testing will now focus on:

symptomatic health-care workers and staff of long-term care facilities and prisons
hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms and no alternative diagnosis
residents of long-term care facilities and other vulnerable communities
Symptomatic travellers from outside New Brunswick will continue to be tested.

Russell emphasized the continued importance of New Brunswickers being on alert for COVID-19 symptoms – a new or exacerbation of a chronic cough or a fever – among themselves and their families. People should use the self-assessment tool at the www.gnb.ca website for guidance and contact 811 if they have symptoms.

“If you have the symptoms of COVID-19, you must act as if you have COVID-19,” said Russell. “That means isolating yourself immediately for at least 14 days. Do not put others at risk by behaving as if you do not have this disease.

“More than ever, what you do matters. What each of us does matters. It remains within our capability to slow the progress and limit the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak.”

“Since this pandemic began, we have all been asked to make sacrifices,” said Higgs. “We need all of you to do your part. We need you to continue to stay at home and keep a safe physical distance from other people. We need you to help us flatten the curve.”

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, stressed the importance of relying on credible and trusted sources of information regarding the pandemic.

“We work closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada to ensure accurate information is provided as quickly as possible,” said Russell. “Provincial and federal authorities are in constant contact with the World Health Organization, so that we can provide guidance based on hard facts, evidence-tested protocols and best practices learned in other jurisdictions where the pandemic is further advanced.’’

Improved testing and new equipment

The province has received a donation from the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation’s COVID-19 emergency fund to upgrade testing and to purchase equipment.

“This donation is one example of the how the people in this province are coming together to support one another,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “I thank the many generous donations that have been made to the foundation. Every dollar will make a difference during this crisis.”

Seven locations across New Brunswick, in both regional health authorities, will have the capability to find out the results of COVID-19 tests faster. The sites will be in Edmundston, Campbellton, Bathurst, Miramichi, Moncton, Fredericton and Saint John.

In addition, two portable Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Life Support Systems are being purchased. As COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, lung capacity and function can be severely affected. These machines oxygenate the blood, allowing the lungs to rest.

New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit

The Red Cross is administering the provincial government’s one-time $900 income benefit for workers or self-employed people in New Brunswick who have lost their jobs due to the state of emergency. So far 50,700 individuals have registered for the program.

“This number illustrates just how critical this program is,” said Higgs. “We will continue to find ways to cover any gaps, to protect our workers and our economy.”

Applications may be completed online or by calling the Red Cross at 1-800-863-6582 (toll free) from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week.

Renewed and revised mandatory order

The state of emergency declaration issued on March 19 has been extended for another 14 days with the approval of the all-party cabinet committee on COVID-19 and the cabinet.

The provincial government today revised the mandatory order under the Emergency Measures Act.

The new sections include:

Campgrounds have been added to the list of business operations that are prohibited from admitting patrons for a two-week period. The owners and managers of premises that permit the seasonal docking of multiple recreational vessels must either prohibit docking or take steps to ensure minimal interaction of people.
Owners and occupiers of land are now responsible to take all reasonable steps to prevent social or recreational gatherings.
Open fires are prohibited until May 1.
Adjustments have been made at the new border control points to allow people to get to work, to see their children, and to access necessities.
Everyone is prohibited from knowingly approaching within two metres of another person, except members of their household or as needed for work.

Assistance for post-secondary students

The Emergency Bridging Fund for Vulnerable Post-Secondary Students will support students who are directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds will be distributed by post-secondary institutions based upon eligibility criteria and will provide a one-time amount of up to $750 per student.

“The fund will support post-secondary students, including international students, who demonstrate a financial gap in meeting their basic needs between now and the end of the term,” said Premier Blaine Higgs.

Students must contact their institution directly to be considered and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Funding support will be based upon the need for food, shelter, unanticipated medical costs not covered through health plans, and unforeseen additional academic costs.

To qualify, vulnerable students must not qualify for the one-time $900 provincial emergency fund as of March 30. They must be in a position in which they cannot access money through student loans, Employment Insurance, personal savings, or other COVID-19 related financial assistance programs.

Parks

Higgs said today that if municipalities are going to keep their parks and trails open, they must have mechanisms in place to ensure that the limitations on the number of people that can gather is enforced.

“Appropriate signage must be put up at access points to identify limitations on gatherings and the requirements for physical distancing,” said Higgs. “If a municipality cannot monitor usage of their premises, they should be closed.”

The mandatory order under the Emergency Measures Act suspends the right for landlords to evict tenants for non-payment of rent, through to May 31.

“People can still be evicted,” said Higgs. However, the reason for the eviction cannot be that they are unable to pay their rent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All other tenant obligations remain.”

Higgs said today that if municipalities are going to keep their parks and trails open, they must have mechanisms in place to ensure that the limitations on the number of people that can gather is enforced.

“Appropriate signage must be put up at access points to identify limitations on gatherings and the requirements for physical distancing,” said Higgs. “If a municipality cannot monitor usage of their premises, they should be closed.”

Landlords and tenants

Higgs clarified confusion that has arisen around the state of emergency and how it impacts tenants.

The mandatory order under the Emergency Measures Act suspends the right for landlords to evict tenants for non-payment of rent, through to May 31.

“People can still be evicted,” said Higgs. However, the reason for the eviction cannot be that they are unable to pay their rent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All other tenant obligations remain.”

If somebody is unable to pay their rent, they must discuss the matter with their landlord and make the appropriate arrangements for payment.",

Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified four new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 95.

Of the 95 cases, 54 are travel-related, 28 are close contacts of confirmed cases, three cases are from community transmission and 10 cases remain under investigation.

In six cases individuals were hospitalized, but two have since been discharged. Four patients remain in hospital, with one in the intensive care unit.

To date, 25 people have recovered.

The new cases are:

An individual aged 30-39 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)

“As we see our cases continue to increase it is important that we keep washing our hands, continue to practise physical distancing and also continue to stay at home,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “What we do now to flatten the curve will save lives in our province. We have community transmission so please follow the guidelines.”

Assistance for post-secondary students

The Emergency Bridging Fund for Vulnerable Post-Secondary Students will support students who are directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds will be distributed by post-secondary institutions based upon eligibility criteria and will provide a one-time amount of up to $750 per student.

“The fund will support post-secondary students, including international students, who demonstrate a financial gap in meeting their basic needs between now and the end of the term,” said Premier Blaine Higgs.

Students must contact their institution directly to be considered and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Funding support will be based upon the need for food, shelter, unanticipated medical costs not covered through health plans, and unforeseen additional academic costs.

To qualify, vulnerable students must not qualify for the one-time $900 provincial emergency fund as of March 30. They must be in a position in which they cannot access money through student loans, Employment Insurance, personal savings, or other COVID-19 related financial assistance programs.

Testing will continue to focus upon the protection of health-care workers, patients in hospitals and nursing homes, as well as first responders. Priority will also be given to testing those who may be more vulnerable to the disease, including people over 60 and people with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, or cancer.

Two new cases

Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified two new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 105.

Of the 105 cases, 59 are travel-related, 33 are close contacts of confirmed cases, six cases are from community transmission and seven cases remain under investigation.

Ten patients were hospitalized, but three have since been discharged. Seven patients remain in hospital, with four in an intensive care unit.

To date, 39 people have recovered.

The new cases are:

An individual aged 10-19 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)
An individual aged 70-79 in Zone 7 (Miramichi region)
“COVID-19 can strike anyone, of any age, in any community in our province,” said Russell. “That is why it remains vital that every New Brunswicker stay at home as much as possible. When people go out, they should keep their interactions brief and maintain six feet of physical distance between themselves and others.”

Loans for working capital now available

Small, medium and large employers in New Brunswick whose businesses have been impacted by COVID-19 can now apply to the provincial government for loans for working capital.

“We understand that this pandemic is impacting New Brunswick business,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “We acted swiftly to address the needs of the business community and support these employers during this challenging time.”

The new loans are to support New Brunswick-based companies. A total of $50 million has been allocated for two distinct loan programs for working capital.

Businesses can access more information about the application processes on a dedicated web page which features frequently asked questions and online resources.

Deadline approaching for applications for income benefit

Applications for the New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit will end at 8 p.m. on Thursday, April 9. The one-time $900 benefit was created to help to bridge the time between when people lose their employment or close their business to when they receive their federal benefit.

“This benefit has provided some much-needed relief,” said Higgs. “Helping workers and self-employed people with their immediate needs will keep us on a trajectory that will bring prosperity back to New Brunswick.”

More than 60,000 applicants have registered for the benefit. To date the provincial government has provided more than $20 million in benefit payments.

Religious gatherings restricted during state of emergency

Residents are reminded that as part of the state of emergency for COVID-19, restrictions are in place for all gatherings, including religious celebrations.

Clergy members can livestream a religious service, but individuals operating video equipment must maintain the physical distancing requirements of two metres.

“With Easter weekend approaching, it is important to remember that in-person religious services in New Brunswick are prohibited,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “With your co-operation, we will make Easter and all religious observations as safe as possible for everyone.”

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, has directed New Brunswickers not to hold family gatherings, attend in-person religious services or hold recreational events over the Easter weekend, to avoid further spread of the COVID-19 virus.

“The temptation to gather with friends and loved ones will be great this weekend,” said Russell. “You may think ‘it’s just my family’ or ‘it’s just my friends.’ But the COVID-19 virus may be an uninvited guest at your event, brought along by someone who has only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. Do not let that happen.”

Buying essentials

Residents are reminded that many retailers will be closed on Good Friday and Easter Sunday.

Higgs encouraged people to make any essential purchases in advance, or plan to wait until next week, and to continue to observe restrictions and physical distancing requirements.

“We are grateful for all the essential retail workers who continue to provide important services and necessities,” said Higgs. “For everyone’s safety, we ask that households choose one person to be the designated shopper, whenever possible.”

The new case is an individual aged 40-49 in Zone 5 (Campbellton region).

“It is encouraging to see this slow growth in the number of confirmed cases,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “It is only natural to wonder if this indicates an end to the outbreak. But we must not get ahead of ourselves and we must continue to do all that we can to slow the spread of COVID-19.”

Extra-Mural Program  

The Extra-Mural Program provides a unique benefit to the province by offering at-home care to people who might otherwise require hospitalization.

Russell said the program is taking steps to reduce the risk of spreading the virus through its work by providing care remotely, when possible, and screening patients and employees.

“As with any other health-care setting, it is very important that you be truthful with Extra-Mural staff about any symptoms you may be experiencing,” said Russell. “They need to be ready if COVID-19 is potentially present in your home and to have the appropriate protective equipment when they visit.”

Long-term care workers

Premier Blaine Higgs said he will be exploring further an announcement by the federal government to supplement the salaries of essential workers, including those employed at long-term care facilities, who earn less than $2,500 per month.   

“We have not received a lot of detail on how this program would work or how many – if any – New Brunswick workers will qualify,” said Higgs. “We believe that our front-line workers deserve all the support they can get, and I look forward to speaking with the other premiers, as well as the prime minister and the deputy prime minister, to learn more about this program.”

Nunavut-made Public Health Act becomes law

IQALUIT, Nunavut (January 7, 2020) – Nunavut’s new Public Health Act came into force January 1, replacing the version carried over from the Northwest Territories. This new and improved legislation works to modernize the territory’s health system and recognizes the unique needs of Nunavummiut.

“Having a made-in-Nunavut Public Health Act will improve our government’s ability to protect Nunavummiut from disease and other health hazards,” said Minister of Health George Hickes. “The new Act modernizes our public health legislation to ensure processes in place to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy, ensuring Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit are the legislation’s guiding principles.”

Nunavut’s Public Health Act establishes measures relating to health protection and promotion, population health assessment, public health surveillance, disease and injury prevention, and public health emergency preparedness and response. It also outlines requirements in food and water safety, sanitation, and reporting and responding to communicable diseases to strengthen health protection.

The Act establishes the requirements, duties, and powers of the Minister, the Chief Public Health Officer (formerly the Chief Medical Officer of Health) and other officers tasked with protecting the health of Nunavummiut.

Low risk of Coronavirus in Nunavut

On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in China identified an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. China has determined that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is responsible for the outbreak.

Currently, there are no confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus in Nunavut.

The Department of Health is in close contact with the Public Health Agency of Canada and with provincial and territorial Chief Medical Officers of Health to share information for awareness and informed vigilance. The Government of Canada, and provinces and territories have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect, and respond to the spread of serious infectious diseases into and within Canada.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is actively monitoring the situation, and more information will be provided as it becomes available. Nunavummiut travelling abroad are encouraged to consult the Travel Health Notice for China on travel.gc.ca. Additional information about the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can be found on Canada.ca/coronavirus.

Coronavirus: Travellers Remain Vigilant

COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and has now spread to a number of countries. Coronaviruses can cause a range of symptoms from the common cold to more severe breathing problems.

The Department of Health encourages Nunavummiut to remain vigilant when travelling outside of the country. It is important for all travellers to monitor their health for fever, new or worsening cough, and difficulty breathing when returning to Nunavut.

There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut. As of March 2, 2020, approximately 27 cases of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Canada. More than 80,000 cases have been reported abroad, with the majority of these in China.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has assessed the public health risk associated with COVID-19 as low for Canada. Public health risk is continually reassessed as new information becomes available. The Department of Health is in close contact with the Public Health Agency of Canada and with provincial and territorial partners to share information. Currently there are significant preparedness activities underway, and the international situation is being closely monitored.

If you have been travelling through an affected region and you start having symptoms of COVID-19, or you believe you may have been exposed to an individual with the virus, immediately isolate yourself from others and call your local health centre. Describe your symptoms and travel history.

You can also do your part to prevent the spread of infections by washing your hands frequently, covering your mouth with your sleeve when you cough or sneeze, and avoiding contact with others when you are not feeling well.

While there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut, the territory and Canada remain on high alert. The GN has extensive plans in place – should there be any cases in our communities – to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut, to contain any spread, and to ensure the continuity of our services and programs.

Prevention and awareness are important – wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds, cough or sneeze into your sleeves, avoid touching your face, and stay home if you are feeling sick. Please monitor for symptoms like fever, an uncontrollable cough, or difficulty breathing, and contact your health centre if you experience them.

The GN is working closely with Health Canada and partners and is ready and prepared, should the situation change.”

Concerns following COVID-19 case at PDAC 2020 convention in Toronto

The Department of Health would like to address concerns that have been circulating following the discovery a person with COVID-19 attended the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada 2020 convention in Toronto, which a number of Nunavummiut also attended.

Those who attended the conference have been requested to exercise self-monitoring, a recommendation for individuals who are at low risk of exposure, are well and not exhibiting symptoms.

These individuals can go about most activities of daily life, but should avoid large gatherings, or going into public settings that they cannot leave. For these people, the following activities would be acceptable:

Working at a desk with more than 1m separation (or behind a closed door).
Getting groceries and other errands.
To be avoided:

Face-to-face meetings.
Air travel.
Dinner out at a restaurant or friends’ homes.
Other festivities (e.g weddings).
In the case that a person does develop symptoms while self-monitoring, they should contact their health centre and be tested. At that time, they will be swabbed and asked to begin self-isolation until the swab results come back.

The best defence against viruses such as COVID-19 continues to be maintaining proper hygiene and illness etiquette.

Stay home if you are sick.
Encourage those you know are sick to stay home.
Change how you greet people to avoid physical contact such as handshakes, hugging or kissing.
Wash your hands regularly.
Cough and sneeze into your sleeve.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as toys, phones, toilets, electronics, bedside tables, television remotes and door handles.

Government of Nunavut response to COVID-19

IQALUIT, Nunavut (March 13, 2020) – Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer, today outlined additional preventive measures and the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) current preparation in response to COVID-19.

“While there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut, it is important that all measures are taken to minimize risks for Nunavummiut,” said Dr. Patterson. “The additional preventive steps we are taking today and our whole-of-government approach are aligned with nation-wide initiatives and will ensure the GN is ready should the situation change.”
Until further notice, Nunavummiut are asked to avoid international travel and reduce non-essential travel within Canada. In-territory travel is not restricted at this time. All non-essential duty travel for GN employees is cancelled, effective immediately. International school-sponsored trips have been cancelled.

GN public events will be cancelled. Nunavummiut should avoid mass gatherings and refrain from going to community airports unless required. Nunavummiut are encouraged to limit visiting.

As of today, sick notes will no longer be issued by Health until further notice. Health also recommends that organizations in Nunavut waive the requirement for sick notes. The GN waived sick notes requirements for employees last week.

The Department of Health has a long-standing territorial pandemic plan. Health centres in all communities have the necessary supplies and are ready to respond. Increased sanitary measures are in effect in GN departments and airports. Schools across the territory have been directed on enhanced cleaning protocols, hygiene and disinfecting measures and implementing non-sharing protocols.

The Territorial Emergency Management Committee made up of senior Health staff, representatives in all regions of Nunavut, along with Nunavut Emergency Management, monitors the status of all territorial health facilities and coordinates Health’s response to COVID-19 within the territory.

Additionally, GN departments are meeting daily to coordinate their preparedness efforts. Health is actively working with partners across the country to ensure a coordinated response.

“I understand this is an uncertain, evolving situation. It is normal to be concerned, but we are prepared. The best course of action is to stay aware and use preventive measures: if you are sick, stay home; observe travel restrictions and listen to the advice of health professionals.” said Dr. Patterson.

IQALUIT, Nunavut (March 13, 2020) – Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer, today outlined additional preventive measures and the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) current preparation in response to COVID-19.

“While there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut, it is important that all measures are taken to minimize risks for Nunavummiut,” said Dr. Patterson. “The additional preventive steps we are taking today and our whole-of-government approach are aligned with nation-wide initiatives and will ensure the GN is ready should the situation change.”
Until further notice, Nunavummiut are asked to avoid international travel and reduce non-essential travel within Canada. In-territory travel is not restricted at this time. All non-essential duty travel for GN employees is cancelled, effective immediately. International school-sponsored trips have been cancelled.

GN public events will be cancelled. Nunavummiut should avoid mass gatherings and refrain from going to community airports unless required. Nunavummiut are encouraged to limit visiting.

As of today, sick notes will no longer be issued by Health until further notice. Health also recommends that organizations in Nunavut waive the requirement for sick notes. The GN waived sick notes requirements for employees last week.

The Department of Health has a long-standing territorial pandemic plan. Health centres in all communities have the necessary supplies and are ready to respond. Increased sanitary measures are in effect in GN departments and airports. Schools across the territory have been directed on enhanced cleaning protocols, hygiene and disinfecting measures and implementing non-sharing protocols.

The Territorial Emergency Management Committee made up of senior Health staff, representatives in all regions of Nunavut, along with Nunavut Emergency Management, monitors the status of all territorial health facilities and coordinates Health’s response to COVID-19 within the territory.

Additionally, GN departments are meeting daily to coordinate their preparedness efforts. Health is actively working with partners across the country to ensure a coordinated response.

“I understand this is an uncertain, evolving situation. It is normal to be concerned, but we are prepared. The best course of action is to stay aware and use preventive measures: if you are sick, stay home; observe travel restrictions and listen to the advice of health professionals.” said Dr. Patterson.

Temporary Nunavut-wide school and daycare closures as precaution to COVID-19

IQALUIT, Nunavut (March 16, 2020) – Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer, today recommended the temporary closure of all schools and daycares in Nunavut to limit any potential spread of COVID-19. These closures are effective starting Tuesday, March 17 for a three-week period.

“It is with an over-abundance of caution that I have made this recommendation,” said Dr. Patterson. “While there are still no confirmed cases in Nunavut, this approach aligns with preventive measures in several jurisdictions across the country and ensures the potential spread of COVID-19 is mitigated.”

During this period, affected Government of Nunavut employees will be accommodated and are encouraged to work flex hours or work from home.

The best way to be prepared for COVID-19 is to be aware, and wash your hands, often, for at least 20 seconds; cough and sneeze into your elbow; stay home if you feel sick; and call your health centre if you have symptoms. Families should avoid group gatherings and remain at home as much as possible.

“We are taking no chances with the health of Nunavummiut, and need to ensure that we take every possible precaution,” said Premier Joe Savikataaq. “Stay home and limit visiting, especially with Elders. Now is the time for our communities to show resiliency and help one another. If you are well, call to check on each other and share what you have, like we have always done. During this uncertain time, our kindness and consideration of others matters more than ever.”

Statement

Chief Public Health Officer recommends self-isolation for travelers to Nunavut

Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Michael Patterson today released the following statement:

“While there are still no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut, we want to protect all Nunavummiut. As such, it is my recommendation that if you have arrived in Nunavut since Sunday, March 15, and are not in an essential service delivery position, that you immediately start to self-isolate for a period of 14 days.

Family members and those living with people who are self-isolating, but did not travel themselves should self-monitor, limit non-essential outings and practice strong social distancing – stay two metres apart from others, avoid physical contact and wash your hands often.

It is our collective responsibility to protect one another and reduce the spread of COVID-19, and this measure will help to ensure that.”

IQALUIT, Nunavut (March 18, 2020) – Premier Joe Savikataaq today announced that the Government of Nunavut (GN) will begin transition to have non-essential public servants work from home, in light of the rapidly-changing COVID-19 situation. These measures will fully come into effect by end of day, Friday, March 20.

“The health and well-being of our employees is critical. In keeping with our advice to practice social distancing, we are shifting our public service to work from home,” said Premier Savikataaq. “This is an evolving situation, so we want to have staff prepared to work remotely, where possible. Essential service positions will continue to work in-office, as much as possible.”

GN employees will work with their supervisors to find ways to perform duties and job requirements away from the office.  

“We ask for patience and understanding as we continue to provide necessary programs and services for Nunavummiut. There may be delays, and certain non-essential programs and services will have to be suspended temporarily. Rest assured, we are working hard and making sure Nunavummiut are taken care of during this time,” said Premier Savikataaq.

Deputy Minister of Family Services update regarding student travel back to Nunavut, March 23, 2020

Family Services, Health, Education, and Community & Government Services have been working together to ensure the safe return of students from southern-based educational institutions to their home communities across Nunavut.

Those students who wish to return home now, will require immediate isolation in central points for a 14-day period prior to an arranged charter plane to return to Nunavut. The two host facilities for students will be located in Ottawa and Winnipeg. Kivalliq and Kitikmeot Region students will muster in Winnipeg to commence a 14-day period once the last student arrives in to the facility. Baffin/Qikiqtani Region students will muster in an Ottawa facility, and likewise – once the last student arrives into the facility a 14-day period will commence. A charter from each of those cities will then return the students to Nunavut.

During the period of quarantine in Ottawa and Winnipeg, the students will have access to tools to complete their studies, will have access to health professionals who will check in to ensure their health needs are met. (There will also be an oversight group tasked with monitoring and addressing issues coming out of this operation)

Message to Students: If you wish to get home as soon as possible, please be packed and ready to get to one of the two mustering points. There will be maximum baggage amounts for both the commercial airlines and for the final chartered flight.

For those with special needs or requirements, they should be identified with the travel team member that contacts you.

And for those that are remaining to complete their terms in place, but wish to return home afterward, FANS will cover until the first available arrangements can be made home.

It is my understanding that for the other populations returning to Nunavut, there are avenues to take. For the travel coverage, usual FANS process would continue.

Emails will be sent out to students today asking them to provide FANS the necessary level of details and giving them the information, they need.

The Corrections division has been working diligently at all levels to ensure we have plans in place to support our staff, our inmates and the community throughout this public health emergency. There is currently a great deal of information in the media from other jurisdictions about what is happening within correctional facilities in other jurisdictions.

To ensure Nunavummiut are up to date and aware of the current steps being taken in Nunavut, we are providing the following update. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the virus does not enter the correctional facilities.

Measures already in place include suspending all outside visitation and non-essential traffic. We appreciate the patience and support we have received from inmates and their families in taking this step as we are aware this is not easy.

Given the heightened security risks associated with corrections, we cannot provide specific details regarding our individual institutional plans.

However, we can provide the following information regarding steps begin taken:

All intakes are being isolated for a period of 14 days upon intake.
Institutions have added additional hand sanitizing stations in high traffic areas.
Response/containment kits are being outfitted with gloves, masks, face shields, gowns and instructions for use.
Nurses are diligently screening inmates upon intake for symptoms of COVID-19.
Facilities are increasing food and supply orders to ensure facilities are well stocked in the event of an outbreak.
Increased cleaning protocols to ensure communal surfaces are cleaned on an increased schedule throughout the day.
In addition to these health and safety steps being taken, the department has reviewed all inmates eligible for early release to reduce the inmate population as much as possible.

We will continue to take action that will support the health and safety of our inmates, staff and all Nunavummiut.

The Corrections division has been working diligently at all levels to ensure we have plans in place to support our staff, our inmates and the community throughout this public health emergency. There is currently a great deal of information in the media from other jurisdictions about what is happening within correctional facilities in other jurisdictions.

To ensure Nunavummiut are up to date and aware of the current steps being taken in Nunavut, we are providing the following update. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the virus does not enter the correctional facilities.

Measures already in place include suspending all outside visitation and non-essential traffic. We appreciate the patience and support we have received from inmates and their families in taking this step as we are aware this is not easy.

Given the heightened security risks associated with corrections, we cannot provide specific details regarding our individual institutional plans.

However, we can provide the following information regarding steps begin taken:

All intakes are being isolated for a period of 14 days upon intake.
Institutions have added additional hand sanitizing stations in high traffic areas.
Response/containment kits are being outfitted with gloves, masks, face shields, gowns and instructions for use.
Nurses are diligently screening inmates upon intake for symptoms of COVID-19.
Facilities are increasing food and supply orders to ensure facilities are well stocked in the event of an outbreak.
Increased cleaning protocols to ensure communal surfaces are cleaned on an increased schedule throughout the day.
In addition to these health and safety steps being taken, the department has reviewed all inmates eligible for early release to reduce the inmate population as much as possible.

We will continue to take action that will support the health and safety of our inmates, staff and all Nunavummiut.

There is currently a great deal of information in the media from other jurisdictions about what is happening within correctional facilities in other jurisdictions.

To ensure Nunavummiut are up to date and aware of the current steps being taken in Nunavut, we are providing the following update. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the virus does not enter the correctional facilities.

Measures already in place include suspending all outside visitation and non-essential traffic. We appreciate the patience and support we have received from inmates and their families in taking this step as we are aware this is not easy.

Given the heightened security risks associated with corrections, we cannot provide specific details regarding our individual institutional plans.

However, we can provide the following information regarding steps begin taken:

All intakes are being isolated for a period of 14 days upon intake.
Institutions have added additional hand sanitizing stations in high traffic areas.
Response/containment kits are being outfitted with gloves, masks, face shields, gowns and instructions for use.
Nurses are diligently screening inmates upon intake for symptoms of COVID-19.
Facilities are increasing food and supply orders to ensure facilities are well stocked in the event of an outbreak.
Increased cleaning protocols to ensure communal surfaces are cleaned on an increased schedule throughout the day.
In addition to these health and safety steps being taken, the department has reviewed all inmates eligible for early release to reduce the inmate population as much as possible.

We will continue to take action that will support the health and safety of our inmates, staff and all Nunavummiut.

Department of Education Services, April 3, 2020

On Tuesday, April 7, school staff will be able to access schools on a voluntary basis should they wish to prepare learning packages for students.

The department has a working group developing guidelines for teachers identifying grade-specific areas of focus for learning packages. Packages may look different for each student.

School access is for operational purposes only and not for recreation or other non-education-related activities.

The department has also provided all schools with health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, including respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing.

Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020

Minister of Education update:

Since March 17, Nunavut schools have been closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, parents and caregivers have been asking for educational resources to help their children continue to learn.

Today I am announcing that the Department of Education has developed a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This website offers free access to some of the same educational resources used in our schools.

These include downloadable books and e-books for pre-school ages and up; educational audiobooks and animated videos; tips and activities for learning; and resources for managing stress and mental health.

There will also be links to download the department’s Inuktut language learning apps:

Uqausiit Pinnguarutiit has fun activities that support Inuit language shape and sound recognition, and vocabulary development.
Titirariuqsauti introduces Inuit language symbol sounds and printing paths. 
Qimirrunaut is the department’s new Inuktut e-book library app.
These apps are available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App stores.

Angirrami Ilinniarniq provides links to other online educational resources on subjects such as science, math, history, and social studies. 

I want to also note that although the website launches today, new resources will be regularly added. The priority is to get our Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun resources online as quickly as possible. English and French resources will follow soon after.

All the resources found on this site were created by the Department of Education and its partners, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office, as well as the Departments of Family Services, Health, Environment, and Economic Development and Transportation.

I want to thank all the students, parents, and caregivers for their patience. I know for many of you it has not been easy with schools and child care facilities closed. However, we must all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

I assure you that my department has been working hard to get this website ready as quickly as possible.

I encourage Nunavummiut to explore all the resources this website has to offer. Make learning a part of your daily routine!

Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci.

Department of Education Services, April 3, 2020

On Tuesday, April 7, school staff will be able to access schools on a voluntary basis should they wish to prepare learning packages for students.

The department has a working group developing guidelines for teachers identifying grade-specific areas of focus for learning packages. Packages may look different for each student.

School access is for operational purposes only and not for recreation or other non-education-related activities.

The department has also provided all schools with health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, including respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing.

Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020

Minister of Education update:

Since March 17, Nunavut schools have been closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, parents and caregivers have been asking for educational resources to help their children continue to learn.

Today I am announcing that the Department of Education has developed a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This website offers free access to some of the same educational resources used in our schools.

These include downloadable books and e-books for pre-school ages and up; educational audiobooks and animated videos; tips and activities for learning; and resources for managing stress and mental health.

There will also be links to download the department’s Inuktut language learning apps:

Uqausiit Pinnguarutiit has fun activities that support Inuit language shape and sound recognition, and vocabulary development.
Titirariuqsauti introduces Inuit language symbol sounds and printing paths. 
Qimirrunaut is the department’s new Inuktut e-book library app.
These apps are available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App stores.

Angirrami Ilinniarniq provides links to other online educational resources on subjects such as science, math, history, and social studies. 

I want to also note that although the website launches today, new resources will be regularly added. The priority is to get our Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun resources online as quickly as possible. English and French resources will follow soon after.

All the resources found on this site were created by the Department of Education and its partners, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office, as well as the Departments of Family Services, Health, Environment, and Economic Development and Transportation.

I want to thank all the students, parents, and caregivers for their patience. I know for many of you it has not been easy with schools and child care facilities closed. However, we must all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

I assure you that my department has been working hard to get this website ready as quickly as possible.

I encourage Nunavummiut to explore all the resources this website has to offer. Make learning a part of your daily routine!

Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci.

The Department, along with our colleagues at the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD), have been closely monitoring developments related to COVID-19 and student travel plans. Last week, NLESD cancelled tours planned for Northern Italy. The district has now extended cancellations to all European destinations until the end of April.

This is a difficult but necessary decision, which I fully support, to protect students and staff from risk of exposure and the possibility of quarantine while overseas, or self-quarantine upon their return to the province. The department and district continue to monitor other planned tours and these may also be cancelled as the situation evolves.

We appreciate the continued advice and collaboration from our provincial public health officials, including the province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, who supports a low-risk approach.

We are also working with the school districts and public health officials to raise awareness about the importance of proper hygiene and handwashing practices to help reduce the risk of transmission. While there have been no reported cases of the virus in our province to date, we must be prepared.

Information will be distributed to schools and there is information specifically on hygiene available on the Department of Health and Community’s website. I encourage parents to review this information and to discuss hygiene practices with their children.",

This decision is effective immediately and will be reassessed periodically, as the need arises.

The province’s chief medical officer, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, announced the finding Saturday in a delayed news briefing. Fitzgerald said the woman had returned from a Caribbean cruise, but would not specify timelines. She would not give the woman’s age, but said her symptoms are mild and she’s doing well. She is currently self-isolating. The test has not yet been confirmed through the national laboratory in Winnipeg, The turnaround for such results is about three days. Officials are in the process of tracing those who have been in contact with her. “We knew our province would eventually get cases and there are plans in place to respond,” said Fitzgerald. As of Saturday, there were 121 people across the province in voluntary self-isolation as a precautionary measure. Health care workers have tested 144 people in total, Of those, 67 have been confirmed negative by the national laboratory, Fitzgerald echoed Canada’s top health official, Dr. Theresa Tam, and advised people to avoid non-essential travel outside the country. Those flying domestically should be aware of specific policies in the province’s they are visiting. Information is available on regional health websites as well as on Canada.ca. Everyone who travels outside the country is expected to self-isolate for 14 days upon his or her return. Any traveller who experiences symptoms such as fever, coughing and trouble breathing should call 811 for further guidance. Self-isolation means staying home from work or school, limiting contact with other people in the house, and covering the mouth and nose when coughing. Those Canadians already abroad have been advised to come home as soon as possible to avoid any obstacles that may arise where they are due to a constantly changing situation.Fitzgerald admitted the availability of test swabs has been an issue across the country. She said the province is being judicious about their use while authorities explore the possibility of using different kits. She says hospitals have been on alert since the onset of the COVID-19 globally, but would not specify what plans are in place. “We have an opportunity to get ahead of this,” she said. “We all have a role to play to protect ourselves and the most vulnerable people in our province, and to reduce the spread of COVID-19.” She said people should take the virus seriously, but emphasized the risk is still low for now. She also said there’s no reason to make self-isolation mandatory as everyone so far has been compliant with the advice given them. However a later government release announcing compensation for those who have to stay off work, the province said those returning from abroad “must” self-isolate. There’s no word on whether enforcement measures are in place. Fitzgerald said there are no immediate plans to close schools.",

As a way to proactively prevent the spread of COVID-19, Business Continuity Plans are being implemented. Programs and service delivery will transition from normal operations to a focus on maintaining critical services. As a result:

Employees already deemed critical to their organization’s operations are expected to report to work as normal;
Any other employees required to report to work in-person or at-home on Tuesday, March 17 will be contacted by 9:00 p.m. tonight (Monday, March 16) by their senior management;
Employees required to work from home but who need to visit their office for computers or equipment will be advised by their senior management when it is appropriate to do so, as long as they are not self-isolating due to recent international travel or presenting symptoms;
All other employees should stay at home until advised otherwise. However, they should remain available for possible deployment if required; and,
Out of necessity this direction does not apply to employees in the health care sector. Direction for these employees will come from the regional health authorities.
As you can appreciate, the next couple of days are critical for the implementation of Business Continuity Plans. This is an unprecedented situation and is being monitored very closely. We will continue to communicate information on an on-going basis.

This investment will be for the 2020-21 fiscal year and help community groups respond to the pressures being experienced in communities in the wake of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The COVID-19 global crisis is impacting the social and economic well-being of residents and businesses. With deep roots in communities and regions, community-based organizations are well-positioned to respond to these challenges. The Provincial Government continues to be a valuable partner as we all strive to ensure the health and safety of residents. The investment announced today will help provide certainty to community-based organizations that they can continue to deliver their programs and services. Additionally, the multi-year funding for the 22 community organizations that Premier Ball announced in April 2018 totaling $18 million annually over three years will continue. With approximately 16,000 people working in the community sector and thousands of volunteers throughout the province, the Provincial Government will continue to work collaboratively with community-based organizations to overcome potential issues and capitalize on opportunities to move the sector forward. Quotes “We appreciate the work of community-based organizations every day, and it is in times like the global COVID-19 pandemic that we are facing today that their importance is truly felt. They are our partners and are well-positioned to help families and communities that are in need. It is important that we all stand together in this unprecedented time and take every step we can to support our citizens. This investment of more than $120 million will go a long way towards supporting Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to all of the province’s community-based organizations for being leaders in their communities. We look forward to continuing to work closely with community groups in order to meet the needs of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, especially during the COVID-19 global pandemic.” Honourable Lisa Dempster Minister of Children, Seniors and Social Development",

The Departments of Children, Seniors and Social Development, Advanced Education, Skills and Labour and Municipal Affairs and Environment will partner with Food First NL to provide funding to support community food programs in continuing their important services during this challenging time. This may include increased or unprecedented costs for these community providers such as transportation and supplies. The funding includes $275,000 from the Labour Market Partnerships program, funded under the Canada-NL Labour Market Development Agreement, to support community food providers in addressing staffing issues. Community food programs that are continuing to safely offer services across the province are eligible to apply for this funding. Details are available on Food First NL’s website. Food First NL and the Department of Children, Seniors and Social Development are co-chairing a task group that includes officials from Provincial Government departments and representatives from community food providers. This group is currently mobilizing a variety of resources to make food available to those who need it. For example: The Kids Eat Smart Foundation has worked with schools in the province to distribute the food supplies they had on hand for their programs to families and seniors in the community, as well as the Community Food Sharing Association, which supplies food banks across the province. The School Lunch Association is working on plans to distribute the food supplies they have on hand at schools to food service providers throughout the province. With schools currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Provincial Government is working with both groups to determine the best way to ensure families in the community that need food can get it Food First NL and the Department of Children, Seniors and Social Development are also in discussions with Indigenous groups in Labrador to determine their food supply needs and how these needs can be addressed. The working group is also addressing how to best support community food programs to help ensure staff, volunteers and clients of their services are safe and taking proper COVID-19 precautions as they distribute food in the community.

Quotes “Our government is concerned about how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect food security for the people of the province, including for some of our most vulnerable individuals.

The patient — a retired man in the Eastern Health region — died Sunday, about three days after being hospitalized. Sources tell CBC News his condition deteriorated quickly. His death came 15 days after the province recorded its first case of COVID-19. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Community Services confirmed Monday the death was related to COVID-19. ""We offer our most heartfelt condolences to the family at this difficult time,"" said Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health. Fitzgerald said the individual was 78 years old, had underlying health issues and had been admitted to hospital from his home. She also said that person's case is linked to the Caul's Funeral Home cluster, which now accounts for 111 cases, or 75 per cent of the province's positive tests. Fitzgerald said all 13 new cases are within the Eastern Health region. The government also tightened rules under its public health emergency, including a ban on in-store purchases of lottery tickets, and banning funerals, visitations and wakes. Nine people in the province have been admitted to hospital, with two in intensive care as of Monday. Seven of those hospitalized cases are in the Eastern Health region, one is in Central Health and one is in Labrador-Grenfell. Fitzgerald said seven people have recovered from the virus. As of Monday there have been 2,332 tests for the virus across the province. ​​​​​13 cases are under 20 years old. 22 are between 20 and 39. 23 are between 40 and 49. 32 are between 50 and 59. 29 are between 60 and 69. 29 are 70 years old and above. Fitzgerald said the number of new cases has dropped each day since Friday because cases are now further away from the Caul's cluster. She added only time will tell what the virus pattern will be. Health Minister John Haggie said now is not a time to be complacent. ""This is the time to stay the course,"" he said. ""Just because we've seen a dip in numbers doesn't mean to say it's the start of a new trend.… We are not out of the woods yet."" Haggie said between 200 and 300 test samples are submitted to the local public health lab each day, and the testing machine's capacity is at least 600. He added the province has not been advised of any bottlenecks by the public health laboratory in Eastern Health but the lab is working on increasing its testing capacity.  ""Those changes could be in place as early as the end of this week,"" he said. Haggie also said that after three weeks of the provincial government's physical distancing recommendations and restrictions, he's worried there are still people who are not taking them seriously. ""This is really not a game. You need to stop looking for loopholes, ways to get around the recommendations and orders that our chief medical officer of health has put in place,"" he said. The health minister said shopping can no longer be a family activity, and must be kept to essential items only. ""One person, one trip, each week. Don't take your children with you unless there is really no alternative,"" he said. ""It's not the time to be out test driving cars."" Premier Dwight Ball added travelling should only be done for essential items and out of necessity. ""Don't just drive around to get out of your house,"" he said. 75 per cent of cases from funeral home The Caul's cluster accounts for 75 per cent of the province's caseload, with 111 being traced back to a single wake. ""This is a solemn day for our province,"" Ball said Monday during the province's daily update. ""As we see the first death of a resident of our province due to complications of COVID-19 virus, we have a family in our province who is grieving and impacted at the greatest extent of this virus."" Fitzgerald announced new measures to further prevent the spread of the virus. Funeral services, visitations and wakes are now prohibited. Burials and weddings are limited to no more than five people, including the officiant. When asked if there was a way for people to use technology to spend final moments with loved ones, Haggie said he'd be open to the idea. ""I would actually have to check with the with the facilities across the province to see what the various states of readiness is,"" he said. Retail stores that remain open to sell essential items have to stop selling lottery tickets, including scratch-offs and break-open tickets. St. Anthony hospital staff tested Labrador-Grenfell Health said a patient at the Charles S. Curtis Memorial Hospital in St. Anthony tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday, and a small number of staff identified as having close contact with them. The health authority said in a news release on Monday staff have been tested for the virus, are in quarantine and being monitored. Mother Nature continues to hammer parts of the province with wet weather and high winds, adding an extra burden to health-care workers at the drive-thru testing centre in St. John's. However, Eastern Health says changes have been made to the site at St. Teresa's School on Mundy Pond Road in St. John's. The original tent structure, which was opened March 21, was replaced by a new wooden structure to provide better protection from the weather, with automatic garage doors, said a statement from Eastern Health. Fitzgerald also said people in self-isolation living in apartment complexes or condominiums are not permitted to use common spaces and must remain on their own property. Newfoundland and Labrador has the second highest rate of infection per capita in Canada. The death toll across the country has now risen to 67 nationwide, with the largest concentrations in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. Tracking the coronavirus This past weekend saw two significant developments. The first instances of what's called community transmission were confirmed. On Saturday, Fitzgerald said the cases were in the Central Health region and the Labrador-Grenfell Health region. Community transmission refers to a case that public health staff cannot connect to another proven case. Fitzgerald said this development was expected, and stressed staying indoors to limit the spread of the disease.",

This will cover all individuals whose MCP eligibility otherwise expired as of March 1, 2020 onward, excluding those who have permanently moved out of Newfoundland and Labrador. The extension preserves provincial public health coverage for those Newfoundland and Labrador residents, including permanent residents, who are outside the province or country, but are finding it difficult to return home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes those residents who are working temporarily or vacationing abroad. The extension also preserves coverage for international students and workers whose study or work durations have ended, but who may not have a reasonable means of departing the province at this time or who wish to leave temporarily to be with family. It also helps them in the event that they are experiencing difficulties obtaining the documentation necessary from their education institutions or employers to renew their MCP coverage. These changes eliminate the need to mail, fax or drop off MCP renewal applications to the MCP offices in St. John’s or Grand Falls Windsor during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals are encouraged to check their MCP expiry date or renewal notice to determine if these measures apply. Renewal cards reflecting the extension of coverage will not be mailed to individuals. Health care providers may contact the MCP offices for confirmation of coverage. Staff will continue to be available to answer questions from the public. People can call the St. John’s office at 1-866-449-4459 or the Grand Falls-Windsor office at 1-800-563-1557. People can also email questions to mcpregistration@gov.nl.ca.

Lors de sa marche, hier, il a dit avoir rencontré des Québécois positifs, prêts à livrer la bataille de leur vie.

« Ça me donne beaucoup d’énergie d’entendre vos mots d’encouragement, de voir vos sourires. Notre défi, ça va être de garder cet espoir, cette attitude positive au cours des prochaines semaines. Notre autre défi, ça va être que les Québécois restent unis, même si on prend nos distances actuellement ! »

Tests à la hausse
Lors de son point de presse quotidien, le premier ministre a indiqué qu’avec plus de 58 000 tests effectués, le Québec fait maintenant partie des nations qui testent le plus dans le monde. M. Legault a tenu à saluer le travail remarquable des infirmières et des techniciens de laboratoire.

On dénombre 2840 cas confirmés de contamination à la COVID-19, une hausse de 342 cas par rapport à la veille. M. Legault a demandé aux Québécois de ne pas relâcher leurs efforts et de suivre scrupuleusement les directives et consignes de santé publique.

Respectez les directives
Si une personne revient de voyage, elle doit se placer obligatoirement en quarantaine pendant 14 jours, sans sortie possible, sauf pour passer un test de dépistage. M. Legault a également rappelé à tous les Québécois que les déplacements d’un quartier ou d’une ville à l’autre sont à éviter, et ce, dans toutes les régions du Québec.

Depuis samedi, tous les déplacements non essentiels ne sont plus tolérés dans 8 régions et territoires plus éloignés, afin d’éviter de propager le virus auprès des populations plus vulnérables qui y vivent. « Actuellement, ces régions sont, toutes proportions gardées, moins infectées que celles du sud du Québec. Notre objectif, c’est que ça reste comme ça. »

Concernant Montréal et l’Estrie, les deux régions les plus touchées, le premier ministre a demandé aux responsables de la santé publique d’identifier les quartiers plus touchés et de les communiquer aux citoyens pour les inciter à éviter de les fréquenter.

Aide pour les CHSLD privés et les résidences de personnes âgées et vulnérables
M. Legault a mentionné que les personnes les plus vulnérables et sujettes à contracter la COVID-19 demeurent nos aînés. Pour aider les ressources en hébergement à faire face aux défis liés à la pandémie de la COVID-19, le gouvernement du Québec a débloqué des budgets additionnels. La ministre responsable des Aînés et des Proches aidants, Marguerite Blais, donnera tous les détails de cette aide d’urgence prochainement.

Merci aux livreurs
Le premier ministre a réservé ses remerciements du jour à tous les livreurs qui, depuis plusieurs jours, viennent en aide à nos personnes âgées ainsi qu’aux personnes de retour de voyage et placés en quarantaine, en leur livrant des biens essentiels, notamment de la nourriture et des médicaments.

M. Legault a également remercié les trois chefs de l’opposition à l’Assemblée nationale, Pierre Arcand, Manon Massé et Pascal Bérubé. « Je leur parle deux fois par semaine et ils m’apportent d’excellentes suggestions. J’apprécie beaucoup leur collaboration », a-t-il conclu.",

Une ordonnance de la santé publique sera en vigueur pour les régions et territoires suivants :

le Bas-Saint-Laurent ;
l’Abitibi-Témiscamingue ;
la Côte-Nord ;
le Nord-du-Québec ;
le Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean ;
la Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine ;
le Nunavik ;

Ainsi, à partir de 16 h, aujourd’hui, seuls les déplacements essentiels vers ces territoires seront permis. Les points de contrôle policier seront installés sur les grands axes pour retourner vers leur région d’origine les gens qui ne respectent pas ce critère.

La ministre de la Sécurité publique, Geneviève Guilbault, a expliqué que cette mesure vise à protéger ces régions et territoires, qui dénombrent actuellement moins de cas positifs et dont les populations sont parfois plus vulnérables et plus isolées. En limitant ainsi les entrées et sorties, les autorités de santé publique ont confiance de pouvoir limiter et de prévenir davantage la propagation de la COVID-19.

Mme Guilbault a rappelé à tous les Québécois que tous les déplacements non essentiels entre les régions doivent être évités.

Points de contrôle aux abords des douanes américaines
À la suite de clarifications apportées par les autorités de santé publique du gouvernement fédéral, hier après-midi, il est dorénavant obligatoire pour toute personne qui revient de l’étranger de se placer en isolement pendant 14 jours, sans sortir de son domicile. Même une simple marche n’est plus permise pour ces personnes. Elles pourront sortir uniquement pour aller passer un test de dépistage en cas d’apparition de symptômes de la COVID-19.

Afin d’assurer l’application de cette directive, Geneviève Guilbault a indiqué que depuis 9 h samedi matin, des points de contrôle ont été mis en place le long de la frontière américaine. Les policiers y informent les personnes qui reviennent de voyage de leurs obligations, en plus d’établir un contact pour qu’un suivi soit ensuite effectué auprès d’elles.

Éviter un climat de suspicion
La vice-première ministre a invité les citoyens à faire preuve de vigilance et à signaler des situations qui mettent clairement en jeu la santé de la population, comme des rassemblements dans les parcs. Elle a toutefois appelé les citoyens à faire preuve de civisme et de ne pas faire appel aux forces de l’ordre sans raison valable.

« Il faut éviter qu’un climat de suspicion s’installe au Québec. N’appelez pas la police seulement parce qu’il y a une voiture de plus dans l’entrée de votre voisin. Ce n’est pas le temps des chicanes de voisins, au contraire. C’est le temps de rester unis pour surmonter cette épreuve ensemble », a-t-elle déclaré.

Mme Guilbault a tenu à remercier les policiers, les pompiers, les employés de la sécurité civile et des services correctionnels qui assurent la sécurité des Québécois au quotidien dans ces moments difficiles.

Bilan de la journée
Le Québec compte maintenant 2 498 cas confirmés de contagion à la COVID-19 et 164 personnes hospitalisées. La vice-première ministre a également eu le regret d’annoncer 4 morts supplémentaires au cours des dernières 24 h, portant le bilan des décès à 22. Au nom du gouvernement du Québec, Mme Guilbault a offert ses sincères condoléances aux familles et aux proches.

« Le bilan d’aujourd’hui nous montre qu’on doit plus que jamais continuer nos efforts pour freiner la propagation du virus.

En 24 h, il y a eu 10 décès supplémentaires liés au coronavirus, portant le bilan des décès à 18. Le premier ministre a tenu, au nom de tous les Québécois, à offrir ses plus sincères condoléances aux familles et aux proches des personnes décédées.

Avec maintenant 2 021 cas confirmés de contamination à la COVID-19 et 141 personnes hospitalisées, M. Legault a appelé les Québécois à tenir bon et à continuer d’appliquer très rigoureusement les consignes de la santé publique. « Je comprends que ce sont des chiffres difficiles à entendre, mais malheureusement, on s’attendait à ça », a-t-il regretté.

Éviter les déplacements à Montréal et en Estrie
Le premier ministre a rappelé que les déplacements non essentiels entre les régions du Québec doivent cesser. Cette consigne est applicable particulièrement pour Montréal et l’Estrie, deux régions particulièrement touchées par la propagation de la COVID-19.

M. Legault a enjoint aux Québécois qui vivent dans ces régions d’appliquer les consignes et de prendre toutes les précautions pour assurer leur propre sécurité et celle de toute la population. « Pour les gens qui sont à Montréal et qui sont en Estrie, c’est encore plus important de rester à la maison autant que possible », a déclaré le premier ministre.

Rappel des consignes : pas de sorties pour les gens affectés ou qui ont des symptômes
François Legault a tenu à partager à nouveau les consignes de confinement : pour toutes les personnes qui reviennent de l’extérieur du Québec, qui sont infectées ou qui ont des symptômes, celles-ci doivent se mettre en quarantaine obligatoire et, donc, ne pas sortir à l’extérieur. « En règle générale, tout le monde devrait rester à la maison, a précisé M. Legault, à l’exception de ceux qui donnent des services essentiels. » Les marches sont permises, tout en respectant une distance de 2 mètres des autres personnes.

Aide aux employés qui travaillent toujours et qui gagnent moins de 2000 $ par mois
Pour les travailleurs à bas salaire dans les services essentiels, le premier ministre leur a assuré que des mesures seront mises en place pour qu’ils gagnent au moins 2 000 $ par mois au total, soit autant que la prestation d’urgence fédérale. C’est une question d’équité.

Concernant les entreprises, le gouvernement du Québec a convenu avec le gouvernement fédéral de reporter les remises de TVQ et de TPS au 30 juin pour leur donner un peu d’oxygène.

Dénoncez la violence et l’abus
François Legault a demandé l’aide de la population en ces temps difficiles : si un enfant est à risque ou qu’une personne est victime de violence, il faut le signaler aux autorités policières. « En ce moment, les personnes vulnérables sont moins visibles à cause du confinement. Nous devons les protéger », a mentionné M. Legault.

Le gouvernement du Québec a d’ailleurs annoncé ce matin une bonification de 2,5 millions de dollars du financement des organismes venant en aide aux femmes victimes de violence.

Site internet Jebenevole.ca :
déjà 12 000 inscriptions
Le premier ministre a tenu à remercier les Québécois qui ont répondu en grand nombre à l’appel lancé hier pour l’aide bénévole. Le portail web a été pris d’assaut par l’entraide et la solidarité des Québécois. Plus de 12 000 bénévoles ont déjà été mis en contact avec les organismes, notamment pour aller chercher de la nourriture aux personnes de 70 ans et plus. « On me dit que les jeunes sont là en grand nombre, a souligné M. Legault. C’est beau de voir ça. Les Québécois sont vraiment généreux, ça me touche beaucoup. »

Merci aux camionneurs
M. Legault a terminé en remerciant les camionneurs, toutes les femmes et les hommes qui parcourent l’Amérique pour s’assurer que les Québécois aient accès à de la nourriture et de tous les produits essentiels. « Votre travail n’est pas facile en ce moment, mais on veut vous dire que vous êtes des héros du quotidien », leur a-t-il témoigné.

Citation :
« Nous sommes en train de livrer la plus grande bataille de notre vie collective. Il faut respecter notre plan : pas de sorties non nécessaires, pas de déplacements non essentiels et si on doit sortir, garder une distance de 2 mètres avec les autres personnes. C’est comme ça qu’on va gagner la bataille. Je compte sur vous ! »

Alors que de nombreux Québécois ont des inquiétudes financières, François Legault a appelé les Québécois qui sont dans le besoin de ne pas être gênés de recourir aux banques alimentaires ou de demander de l’aide pour la livraison de la nourriture. Le ministre Jean Boulet a d’ailleurs annoncé le lancement d’une plateforme web où toute personne, à travers le Québec, disponible et intéressée à donner un coup de main pourra déposer son nom et entrer en contact avec des organismes et d’autres bénévoles de sa région.

M. Legault a d’ailleurs réservé ses remerciements du jour à tous les bénévoles du Québec. Toutes celles et tous ceux qui offriront généreusement de leur temps devront s’inscrire au www.jebenevole.ca This hyperlink will open in a new window.. Évidemment, ils devront s’engager à respecter rigoureusement les mesures de précaution décrétées par la santé publique.

Deux décès supplémentaires
Le Québec compte dorénavant 1 629 cas confirmés de contamination à COVID-19 et 2 décès supplémentaires, portant le bilan à 8 au Québec. M. Legault a tenu à offrir ses condoléances à la famille et aux proches des personnes décédées.

Le premier ministre a réitéré l’importance pour tous les Québécois de garder, et même de renforcer leurs bonnes habitudes.

Pas de compromis sur la protection du personnel de la santé
François Legault n’entend faire aucun compromis sur la protection de la santé. Bien que le réseau dispose d’assez de matériel de protection pour les prochaines semaines, le Québec a un défi d’approvisionnement. M. Legault a rappelé l’importance d’utiliser les masques de façon judicieuse, en les réservant au personnel qui en a véritablement besoin. Le ministère de la Santé travaille fort avec le gouvernement fédéral pour augmenter inventaires.

Il ne faut surtout pas relâcher nos efforts et continuer de respecter les consignes décrétées par la santé publique pour réduire la propagation du virus. Cela dit, le premier ministre a souligné que le Québec est l’un des endroits au monde qui, toutes proportions gardées, a fait le plus de tests, avec plus de 36 000 effectués à ce jour.

Citation :
« Je lance aujourd’hui un appel à tous les Québécois, pour qu’ils aillent aider d’autres Québécois qui sont mal pris. Je demande à tous ceux qui ont du temps, qui n’ont pas de symptômes et qui ont moins de 70 ans, d’aller aider. J’en profite d’ailleurs pour remercier toutes les personnes qui ont déjà commencé à faire du bénévolat. Je veux saluer, en particulier, les municipalités, les maires, les conseillers et les employés qui font un travail extraordinaire pour aider. Merci du fond du cœur à tous les bénévoles ! »

Le premier ministre du Québec, François Legault, y est allé d’un message d’espoir, mercredi, alors que deux décès supplémentaires liés au coronavirus sont survenus au cours des 24 dernières heures, portant le bilan total des décès à six. M. Legault a offert, au nom du gouvernement du Québec, ses sincères condoléances aux familles et aux proches de ces personnes.

François Legault a rappelé que la partie est loin d’être gagnée et qu’il est essentiel que tous gardent leurs bonnes habitudes.

Avertissement aux « snowbirds » : vous devez vous isoler
Le premier ministre a profité de son point de presse quotidien pour lancer un avertissement à tous les « snowbirds » qui arrivent de Floride ou d’ailleurs à l’étranger : « Vous devez vous isoler pour 14 jours. C’est très sérieux. Vous êtes à risque et vous risquez de propager le virus. C’est très important de ne pas sortir de la maison », a déclaré le premier ministre.

Appel aux propriétaires de logements à être conciliants pour le paiement du loyer du mois d’avril
M. Legault a également demandé aux propriétaires de logements locatifs d’être conciliants et de faire preuve de patience pour le paiement du loyer. Plusieurs Québécois sont inquiets financièrement après avoir perdu leur emploi et leur source de revenus dans les derniers jours. « Notre priorité, c’est de s’assurer que tout le monde soit capable de manger et de se loger », a indiqué le premier ministre.

1 339 cas confirmés
Le premier ministre a dressé le plus récent bilan des cas de contamination à la COVID‑19 confirmés. En date du 24 mars 2020, à 21 h, 1 339 personnes étaient infectées au Québec. On dénombrait 78 hospitalisations, dont 35 personnes aux soins intensifs. « Bien qu’on déplore deux décès supplémentaires, le nombre relativement faible d’hospitalisations et de cas aux soins intensifs est encourageant », a indiqué François Legault, qui demande toutefois aux Québécois de ne pas baisser les bras et de continuer à suivre attentivement les consignes de la santé publique.

Protéger nos anges gardiens
Depuis quelques jours, le nombre de tests administrés est à la hausse. Le réseau de la santé continue d’être mobilisé et de se préparer à tous les scénarios. M. Legault a précisé que toutes les précautions sont prises pour protéger le personnel de la santé. « Des ajustements doivent être faits pour la distribution du matériel entre les établissements de santé, mais le réseau dispose de tout l’équipement de protection nécessaire », a assuré le premier ministre.

Prendre soin des plus vulnérables
M. Legault a tenu à saluer tous les Québécois qui ont décidé d’aider les groupes communautaires et les banques alimentaires. Il a assuré que le gouvernement du Québec s’occupe des sans-abri et que des mesures sont prises pour que ces personnes plus vulnérables soient installées dans d’autres endroits sécuritaires.

Finalement, le premier ministre a adressé un merci spécial à tout le personnel qui nettoie et désinfecte nos établissements de santé et aussi tous les autres lieux. Leur tâche est plus importante que jamais et ces travailleurs font eux aussi partie de cette bataille contre le virus.

Citation :
« De plus en plus de personnes respectent les consignes, aident nos personnes vulnérables. Je suis tellement fier de la solidarité des Québécois. Mais il faut continuer. Il y a encore une période difficile à passer, mais ensuite, ça va bien aller. Nous sommes une armée de 8 millions et demi pour combattre le virus.

Dans 50 ans, nos enfants raconteront comment le peuple québécois était uni et comment, ensemble, on a gagné la bataille de notre vie ! »

Le premier ministre du Québec, François Legault, y est allé d’un message d’espoir, mercredi, alors que deux décès supplémentaires liés au coronavirus sont survenus au cours des 24 dernières heures, portant le bilan total des décès à six. M. Legault a offert, au nom du gouvernement du Québec, ses sincères condoléances aux familles et aux proches de ces personnes.

François Legault a rappelé que la partie est loin d’être gagnée et qu’il est essentiel que tous gardent leurs bonnes habitudes.

Avertissement aux « snowbirds » : vous devez vous isoler
Le premier ministre a profité de son point de presse quotidien pour lancer un avertissement à tous les « snowbirds » qui arrivent de Floride ou d’ailleurs à l’étranger : « Vous devez vous isoler pour 14 jours. C’est très sérieux. Vous êtes à risque et vous risquez de propager le virus. C’est très important de ne pas sortir de la maison », a déclaré le premier ministre.

Appel aux propriétaires de logements à être conciliants pour le paiement du loyer du mois d’avril
M. Legault a également demandé aux propriétaires de logements locatifs d’être conciliants et de faire preuve de patience pour le paiement du loyer. Plusieurs Québécois sont inquiets financièrement après avoir perdu leur emploi et leur source de revenus dans les derniers jours. « Notre priorité, c’est de s’assurer que tout le monde soit capable de manger et de se loger », a indiqué le premier ministre.

1 339 cas confirmés
Le premier ministre a dressé le plus récent bilan des cas de contamination à la COVID‑19 confirmés. En date du 24 mars 2020, à 21 h, 1 339 personnes étaient infectées au Québec. On dénombrait 78 hospitalisations, dont 35 personnes aux soins intensifs. « Bien qu’on déplore deux décès supplémentaires, le nombre relativement faible d’hospitalisations et de cas aux soins intensifs est encourageant », a indiqué François Legault, qui demande toutefois aux Québécois de ne pas baisser les bras et de continuer à suivre attentivement les consignes de la santé publique.

Protéger nos anges gardiens
Depuis quelques jours, le nombre de tests administrés est à la hausse. Le réseau de la santé continue d’être mobilisé et de se préparer à tous les scénarios. M. Legault a précisé que toutes les précautions sont prises pour protéger le personnel de la santé. « Des ajustements doivent être faits pour la distribution du matériel entre les établissements de santé, mais le réseau dispose de tout l’équipement de protection nécessaire », a assuré le premier ministre.

Prendre soin des plus vulnérables
M. Legault a tenu à saluer tous les Québécois qui ont décidé d’aider les groupes communautaires et les banques alimentaires. Il a assuré que le gouvernement du Québec s’occupe des sans-abri et que des mesures sont prises pour que ces personnes plus vulnérables soient installées dans d’autres endroits sécuritaires.

Finalement, le premier ministre a adressé un merci spécial à tout le personnel qui nettoie et désinfecte nos établissements de santé et aussi tous les autres lieux. Leur tâche est plus importante que jamais et ces travailleurs font eux aussi partie de cette bataille contre le virus.

Citation :
« De plus en plus de personnes respectent les consignes, aident nos personnes vulnérables. Je suis tellement fier de la solidarité des Québécois. Mais il faut continuer. Il y a encore une période difficile à passer, mais ensuite, ça va bien aller. Nous sommes une armée de 8 millions et demi pour combattre le virus. Nous sommes en train de livrer la plus grande bataille collective de nos vies. C’est un combat pacifique, mais vital. Dans 10, 20, 50 ans, nos enfants vont raconter comment le peuple québécois était uni et comment, ensemble, nous avons gagné la bataille de notre vie. »

À compter de minuit et une minute dans la nuit de mardi à mercredi, tous les services et toutes les activités économiques non essentiels au Québec devront s’arrêter. Le premier ministre a demandé à toutes les organisations qui peuvent fermer dès aujourd’hui de le faire, en soulignant que le télétravail pourra continuer et que les fermetures concernent les lieux physiques.

Pour consulter la liste des services et activités commerciales essentiels, veuillez consulter le site internet Québec.ca/coronavirus This hyperlink will open in a new window.. M. Legault a assuré que la situation sera quotidiennement réévaluée.

Le premier ministre a appelé les chefs d’entreprises et tous les entrepreneurs à profiter de cette pause pour préparer le redémarrage du Québec. Il faudra notamment qu’ils mettent en place des mesures de précaution pour les travailleurs dès la reprise des activités.

Augmentation des cas confirmés
François Legault a indiqué que le Québec entre dans une nouvelle phase dans sa bataille contre le coronavirus, soit celle d’une transmission communautaire. En date du dimanche 22 mars, à 21 h, il y avait 628 cas de personnes testées positives, 45 personnes sont hospitalisées et 20 sont aux soins intensifs. Le bilan des décès demeure inchangé, soit 4.

L’augmentation soudaine des cas découle du fait que la Direction de la santé publique a modifié sa façon de compiler les données, en considérant dorénavant les cas probables qui avaient été identifiés au cours des derniers jours comme des cas confirmés.

Confinement obligatoire pour les personnes âgées en résidences
Le premier ministre a également annoncé que, dorénavant, toutes les sorties des résidences de personnes aînées sont interdites, sauf sous supervision. Cette nouvelle directive, qui s’applique autant au privé qu’au public, est nécessaire pour rassurer les autres résidents de ces résidences et pour éviter que le virus n’entre dans ces établissements. Les visites demeurent interdites.

Pour rassurer nos aînés, le ministère de la Santé mettra en place un service afin de venir en aide à ceux n’ayant pas de proches ou ne disposant pas d’autres moyens pour faire leur épicerie et leurs achats essentiels. Aucune personne aînée ne manquera de nourriture.

François Legault a tenu à ajouter que, bien que les personnes âgées soient plus à risque que d’autres de conséquences graves, toute la population, peu importe l’âge, doit se plier aux exigences de la santé publique. « On doit tous suivre les consignes. Tout le monde », a-t-il martelé, en rappelant l’importance d’éviter les déplacements qui ne sont pas absolument nécessaires, que ce soit d’un quartier à l’autre, d’une ville à l’autre, d’une région à l’autre, et même d’une province à l’autre.

Fermeture prolongée pour les établissements scolaires et d’enseignement supérieur ainsi que les services de garde
Accompagné du ministre de l’Éducation de l’Enseignement supérieur, Jean-François Roberge, le premier ministre a annoncé la prolongation de la fermeture de tout le réseau de l’éducation (écoles primaires et secondaires, publiques comme privées), de l’enseignement supérieur (centres de formation, cégeps et universités, publics comme privés) et des services de garde, et ce, jusqu’au 1er mai.

Afin d’assurer le maintien des acquis, le ministère de l’Éducation offrira rapidement des activités et des vidéos pédagogiques pour faciliter la vie des parents et des élèves. En ce qui concerne les étudiants des cégeps et des universités, à compter du 30 mars, ils pourront compléter leur session en ligne.

Les services de garde d’urgence demeureront ouverts pour soutenir les travailleurs de la santé, des services sociaux et des services essentiels.

Fermeture des centres commerciaux, des salles à manger dans les restaurants ainsi que des salons de coiffure, d’esthétique et de soins personnels à compter de minuit ce soir
Afin d’accentuer les mesures de précaution, le gouvernement du Québec a pris la décision de fermer, à compter de minuit ce soir, et ce, jusqu’au 1er mai prochain :

Les centres commerciaux, à l’exception des magasins alimentaires, des pharmacies et des succursales de la SAQ qui se trouvent à l’intérieur ;
Les salles à manger des restaurants, à l’exception des services pour emporter et de livraison ;
Les salons de coiffure, d’esthétique et de soins personnels.
Il est à noter que les commerces disposant d’une porte extérieure permettant l’accès sans passer par un centre commercial peuvent demeurer ouverts.

Aidez nos aînés à rester chez eux, par exemple en faisant leur épicerie
Il faut intensifier nos efforts, a indiqué le premier ministre. Selon M. Legault, on ne le répétera jamais assez : il est important que les personnes âgées et les personnes à risque demeurent chez elles.

Le premier ministre a fait appel aux Québécois et aux proches qui les entourent afin qu’ils les aident, notamment en leur livrant l’épicerie ou d’autres biens. Rappelons que les personnes de 70 ans et les personnes ayant une condition les rendant plus à risque en cas d’infection à la COVID-19 ne doivent courir aucun risque, en restant à domicile.

Rappel des directives de la santé publique
M. Legault a rappelé que les directives de la santé publique sont claires :

Si vous avez des symptômes, restez à la maison et isolez-vous.
Même si vous n’avez pas de symptômes, vous pouvez être porteur du virus ; évitez donc tous les déplacements – à l’étranger et entre les régions – qui ne sont pas nécessaires.
Lavez souvent vos mains avec du savon.
Évitez les contacts physiques, notamment en respectant une distance de 2 mètres avec les autres.
Respectez l’interdiction de visiter les maisons de personnes âgées, sauf pour des raisons humanitaires sérieuses.
Le premier ministre a également invité toutes les personnes qui ressentent des symptômes à dire la vérité. « C’est important de dire la vérité pour ne pas mettre la vie des autres en danger, a-t-il fait savoir. Plus vite l’ensemble des Québécois se conformeront à ces consignes, plus vite le Québec sortira de l’état d’urgence. »

Équipements en quantité suffisante
Concernant les équipements, le premier ministre a réitéré que les mesures sont prises afin de disposer de quantités suffisantes pour les prochaines semaines. Des discussions sont en cours avec le gouvernement fédéral ainsi qu’avec des distributeurs et manufacturiers provinciaux, nationaux et internationaux pour s’assurer que tous les équipements nécessaires soient disponibles pour la suite de la crise. Des entreprises québécoises ont d’ailleurs été sollicitées pour fabriquer certains équipements, au cas où des commandes d’ailleurs seraient annulées.

Finalement, François Legault a de nouveau souhaité remercier tous les travailleurs du réseau de la santé, notamment les éducatrices qui prennent soin des enfants de nos anges gardiens. « L’esprit de collaboration et de solidarité qui règne au Québec depuis plusieurs jours est extraordinaire », s’est réjoui le premier ministre.

« Tout ce que nous avons fait au Québec depuis 10 jours va faire une différence, mais nous devons absolument intensifier nos efforts. Toutes nos mesures visent à ralentir la propagation du virus.

Le ministre de l’Économie et de l’Innovation et ministre responsable de la région de Lanaudière, M. Pierre Fitzgibbon, et la ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Mme Danielle McCann, en ont fait l’annonce aujourd’hui.

 

Le 12 mars dernier, Medicago, dont le siège social est situé à Québec, a annoncé avoir produit avec succès un candidat-vaccin contre la COVID-19. La participation du gouvernement du Québec permettra à l’entreprise de mener des études précliniques. L’étude clinique, soit des tests sur un nombre restreint de personnes, devrait être entreprise dès l’été 2020.

 

Soutien à la fabrication de fournitures et d’équipements médicaux
 

Le gouvernement tient à rappeler aux fabricants de fournitures et d’équipements médicaux que le Québec a besoin de leur collaboration et de leur savoir-faire pour traverser la crise sanitaire liée à la COVID-19.

 

Ces entreprises doivent poursuivre leurs activités pour répondre à la demande importante d’accessoires médicaux. Toutes les options sont actuellement évaluées pour les appuyer davantage et s’assurer qu’elles peuvent augmenter leur production et maintenir leurs activités de façon permanente.

 

Les entreprises ayant besoin d’un soutien pour accroître leur capacité de production ou les entreprises manufacturières qui auraient la capacité de convertir rapidement leurs installations pour répondre à la demande en fournitures médicales, comme les gants, les blouses, les désinfectants et les masques (voir l’annexe pour plus de détails), pourraient jouer un rôle important afin de réduire le risque de pénurie à moyen et à long terme. Elles sont donc invitées à faire part de leur intérêt en écrivant à l’adresse courriel suivante: jecontribue@economie.gouv.qc.ca.

Nous ne devons pas oublier non plus la contribution essentielle de nos fabricants de fournitures et d’équipements médicaux, qui doivent répondre à une demande croissante pour leurs produits. Nous regardons actuellement ce que nous pouvons faire pour les appuyer et nous assurer qu’ils peuvent augmenter leur production pour suffire à la demande.»

 

Pierre Fitzgibbon, ministre de l’Économie et de l’Innovation et ministre responsable de la région de Lanaudière

 

«Medicago a franchi la première étape du développement d’un candidat-vaccin contre la COVID-19. L’appui du gouvernement du Québec lui permettra d’entreprendre les tests nécessaires à l’évaluation de l’innocuité et de l’efficacité de ce candidat-vaccin. Rappelons qu’aucun vaccin n’est encore disponible à ce jour. L’entreprise pourrait donc être la première à en commercialiser un dans les prochains mois, ce qui aurait une incidence importante sur la prévention de la maladie.»

«Nous sommes extrêmement reconnaissants envers le gouvernement du Québec pour son engagement envers Medicago et son soutien financier.

CONSIDERING section 118 of the Public Health Act (chapter S-2.2)
providing that the Government may declare a public health emergency in all or part
of the territory of Québec where a serious threat to the health of the population,
whether real or imminent, requires the immediate application of certain measures
provided for in section 123 of the Act to protect the health of the population;

CONSIDERING Order in Council 222-2020 dated 20 March 2020
renewing the public health emergency throughout the territory of Québec for a
period of 10 days and ordering in particular that the measures set out in Order in
Council 177-2020, save exception, continue to apply until 29 March 2020 or until
the Government or the Minister of Health and Social Services modifies or
terminates them;
CONSIDERING that Order in Council 177-2020 provides that the
Minister of Health and Social Services may order any other measure needed to
ensure that the health and social services network has the necessary human
resources;
CONSIDERING THAT it is expedient to order certain measures to
protect the health of the population;
ORDERS AS FOLLOWS:
Order 2020-007 of the Minister of Health and Social Services dated
21 March 2020
THAT the national and local provisions of the collective agreements
in force in the health and social services network and the employment conditions
that apply to non-unionized salaried personnel be amended to enable the employer
to meet the needs of the population, as per the following conditions:
- the sections relating to leaves for union business (union leaves)
are amended to enable the employer to cancel union leaves that have already
been granted or refuse to grant new leaves. Despite the foregoing, union leaves
necessary to deal with the emergency health situation are granted insofar as the
employer is able to ensure the continuity of the activities;
- the sections relating to leave of any nature, with or without pay,
including vacation time, are amended to enable the employer to suspend or cancel
leave already authorized, and to refuse to grant new leave. Following cancellation
of vacation time, a salaried person currently on vacation or having a planned
vacation period, will be automatically be paid 50% of the vacation time at the
regular rate, without the possibility of deferral. As for the other 50% of the vacation
being taken or planned, the salaried person will be offered either of the following
options:
• defer the vacation period to a date after the date ending the public
health emergency, which requires agreement with the employer; or
• receive payment for that vacation period at the regular rate.
For the purposes of this provision, if the number of remaining or
planned vacation days is an odd number, one day is first removed for the sake of
the calculation. At the choice of the salaried person, that day will be deferred to a
later date that is after the date ending the public health emergency, that date
requiring agreement with the employer or payment at the regular rate;
- the sections relating to movement of personnel that deal in
particular with promotion, transfer, demotion, voluntary transfer, bumping
procedures, temporarily vacant positions, replacement, assignment, reassignment or personnel displacement are amended to enable the employer to
assign personnel to the place, at the time or to duties of another position title,
activity centre, certification service or unit, with the employer or another employer
in the health and social service network or in any other designated place, to the
extent that the employee concerned meets the normal requirements of the duties,
without having regard to the notion of position, activity centre, service, shift or any
other provision restricting personnel mobility.
No salaried person is to sustain a reduction in hourly wage as a
result of temporary displacement;
Order 2020-007 of the Minister of Health and Social Services dated
21 March 2020
- the salary insurance plan is amended to enable a salaried person
on disability leave to serve a temporary period of assignment for the purpose of
performing various functions corresponding to the person's residual capabilities,
on the recommendation of the physician designated by the employer. The
assignment may not operate to suspend the disability period or to extend the
period during which benefits are paid;
- the sections relating to work schedules, shifts and positions are
amended to enable the employer to have the necessary human resources
available. The regular work day may be modified, but may not exceed 12 hours.
For the purposes of overtime qualification, the regular work day is the work day
under the new work schedule;
- the sections relating to work time arrangements are amended to
enable the employer to suspend or cancel work time arrangements already
granted or refuse to grant new work time arrangements;
- a part-time salaried person is deemed to have had weekly
availability equal to the number of hours of a full-time salaried person in the
employment position where he or she performs the greater part of duties. The
additional standby availability required to achieve maximum availability may be
apportioned equally between the employers in the health and social services
network where the salaried person works;
- the deadlines for filing a grievance and those for the arbitration
procedure are suspended;
- all grievance arbitration in progress or to come is postponed to a
date after the date ending the public health emergency, unless the parties and the
adjudicator agree on the adoption of alternative measures. In the event that such
measures cannot be agreed on and the hearing is postponed, the hearing
cancellation rules do not apply;
- the sections relating to fixed price contracts or contracts of
enterprise are inoperative;
- the employer may hire additional personnel, granting the status of
temporary salaried person to every person so hired. The hiring contract under that
status is valid for the duration of the public health emergency. Despite the
foregoing, the employer may terminate the contract of employment at any time on
one week's prior notice.
The person hired under the status of temporary salaried person is
entitled only to the provisions of the collective agreements in the health and social
services network relating to remuneration, including bonuses, supplements and
overtime. Despite the foregoing, the salaried person receives the fringe benefits 
Order 2020-007 of the Minister of Health and Social Services dated
21 March 2020
available to part-time salaried persons not covered by life, prescription drug and
salary insurance plans.
The employer is not bound by the requirements of the document
entitled ""Nomenclature des titres d’emploi, des libellés, des taux et des échelles
de salaire du réseau de la santé et des services sociaux"" for any hiring of additional
personnel, except as regards the requirements of professional orders, as long as
the hiring meets the normal requirements of the duties.
The additional personnel so hired is not entitled to vested rights
regarding future hiring and must undergo the standard selection procedure
according to the provisions in force in the institution concerned;
THAT the employment conditions of management personnel and
personnel not covered by the Act respecting bargaining units in the social affairs
sector (chapter U-0.1) be amended in the same manner for the matters concerned.
THAT a health and social services institution, before applying a
measure set out in this Order, be required to consult the local unions or
associations concerned, unless the urgency of the situation does not permit doing
so. In such a case, the unions must be informed as soon as feasible.
THAT the implementation of the local measures pursuant to this
Ministerial Order be subject to the prior approval of the assistant deputy minister

François Legault a déclaré que, s’il y a un secteur économique qu’on peut continuer de faire fonctionner pendant la crise, c’est le secteur de la construction. En effet, la construction représente au Québec plus de 260 000 emplois. Actuellement, en raison de l’éclosion de la COVID-19, beaucoup d’entreprises du secteur privé ont des difficultés et de nombreux emplois sont perdus. Or, le gouvernement du Québec a beaucoup de projets d’infrastructures dans ses cartons, des projets en santé, en éducation, dans le transport en commun et dans la voirie. Il s’agit là d’une belle occasion de remplacer des projets de construction annulés par le secteur privé par des projets dans le secteur public. M. Legault a ajouté que la fermeture des chantiers de construction n’est pas une mesure recommandée par la Direction de la santé publique du Québec.

Le premier ministre a pressé tous les entrepreneurs des chantiers de construction, quelle que soit leur taille, de prendre toutes les précautions possibles pour protéger leurs employés, c’est-à-dire donner accès à des endroits avec de l’eau et du savon pour que les travailleurs puissent se laver les mains et disposer de plus de roulottes pour la prise des repas, afin de respecter la distanciation d’un ou deux mètres entre les employés.

Appel aux entreprises québécoises pour la fabrication d’équipements
Le ministère de la Santé a réussi à libérer 4 000 lits en reportant des chirurgies électives. Le premier ministre a réitéré qu’à l’heure actuelle, la situation demeure sous contrôle. Les autorités de la santé publique assurent à la population que les mesures en place donnent des résultats.

Bien que le réseau de la santé dispose d’assez d’équipements, le gouvernement travaille tout de même sur des scénarios plus pessimistes afin d’être prêt à toute éventualité. C’est la raison pour laquelle des appels ont été faits auprès d’entreprises québécoises pour qu’elles fabriquent, si nécessaire, des masques, des respirateurs et d’autres équipements essentiels.

François Legault a été clair : toute personne qui est malade ou qui présente des symptômes doit demeurer à domicile et s’isoler pendant 14 jours.

« Si on avait besoin d’une preuve de la gravité de la situation, on en a une », a-t-il déclaré, le ton grave, lors d’un point de presse sur la colline Parlementaire, mercredi après-midi.

« La bataille va être dure. La bataille va être longue », a-t-il ajouté, préparant les consciences à d’autres pertes humaines.


Tout comme le premier ministre, les autres chefs des partis politiques Pierre Arcand, Manon Massé et Pascal Bérubé ont tour à tour offert leurs condoléances aux proches de la première victime québécoise de la pandémie de COVID-19.

La résidence pour personnes âgées, dans laquelle la dame logeait, a pris les mesures nécessaires pour stopper la propagation du coronavirus, a indiqué M. Legault en point de presse.

Suivez la propagation de la COVID-19 à travers le monde.
Le directeur national de santé publique, Horacio Arruda, a expliqué que la victime « avait des facteurs de risque importants » avant d’avoir « eu une exposition à quelqu’un qui revenait de voyage ». L’équipe de la Santé publique s’est affairée au cours des derniers jours à retrouver ce dernier ainsi que toutes les autres personnes ayant été en contact avec elle.

Le sous-ministre adjoint a cru bon d’interpeller, une nouvelle fois, les gens qui sont récemment rentrés de l’étranger. « Même si vous pensez que vous ne l’avez pas, c’est très important de s’auto-isoler. Si jamais vous avez des symptômes, allez consulter. N’allez pas contaminer nos personnes à risque. On ne le répétera pas assez », a-t-il lancé.

Selon les informations disponibles au moment d’écrire ces lignes, 94 Québécois souffrent de la COVID-19. Six personnes étaient hospitalisées mercredi après-midi, dont quatre aux soins intensifs en raison de la gravité de leur situation.

94
C’est le nombre de Québécois souffrant de la COVID-19, selon les chiffres publiés mercredi.
Par ailleurs, 3600 personnes étaient en cours d’examen. Environ 5200 individus qui ont subi un test au cours des derniers jours ont pour leur part obtenu un résultat négatif.

Le Dr Arruda refuse de dire que le Québec connaît une « transmission communautaire soutenue ».

Le réseau de la santé est sur le pied de guerre. Les centres hospitaliers comptent 2300 lits disponibles, après avoir retardé des chirurgies non urgentes. « On pourrait délester jusqu’à 6000 lits pour accueillir les personnes qui auraient éventuellement le coronavirus. Donc, je veux vous dire : on a la capacité en lits. On a toute la capacité aussi en équipements pour les prochains jours, les prochaines semaines », a souligné M. Legault en conférence de presse. « Merci à nos anges gardiens. Ils sont là. […] Ils sont prêts », a-t-il assuré à la population.

Ratés à Info-Santé

Le chef du gouvernement a reconnu que la ligne Info-Santé était toujours engorgée mercredi. Il a promis que 450 infirmières seraient mobilisées à compter de mercredi et que 600 infirmières seraient à pied d’oeuvre jeudi « juste » pour répondre au 811.

En Montérégie, une femme atteinte de maladies pulmonaires chroniques a attendu pas moins de sept heures mardi soir pour s’entretenir avec une agente d’Info-Santé qui, après avoir répondu à une batterie de questions ― deux fois en raison d’ennuis techniques ― s’est vu donner un rendez-vous pour un test jeudi soir, à 25 km de son domicile.

« Les cas qui nécessitent de parler avec une infirmière pour un test vont être transférés du 877 au 811. Donc, c’est important que tout le monde appelle le 1-877 [644-4545] », a annoncé M. Legault mercredi.

Convaincre avant de contraindre

M. Legault a aussi pris soin mercredi de réitérer sa demande d’éviter tout rassemblement ― « [y compris dans] tous les lieux de culte, c’est important de le préciser », a-t-il dit.

Le gouvernement du Québec continue de « convaincre » les Québécois de suivre les consignes de distanciation sociale. En cas d’échec, il pourrait les « contraindre » à le faire, a averti le Dr Arruda.

Enfin, le directeur national de santé publique s’est impatienté contre les Québécois masqués et gantés se pensant à l’abri du coronavirus. « Quand on porte des gants, qu’on a touché à tout, si on ne les enlève pas adéquatement, on se contamine.

“What we’re seeing is (economic) disruption, interruption but not destruction,” said Finance Minister Eric Girard.

He said Quebec is doing what it can but many questions are up in the air.

“How many companies (will be helped)? For how long? At this stage, we don’t have the answer because it’s a public health issue,” Girard said.

“Yes, the economy is hard hit, but as soon as the public health issue is over, the economy will rebound.”

Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said restaurants, aerospace, life sciences and tourism are among the most at-risk industries.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business praised today’s announcement.

Restez chez vous autant que possible. » Il a rappelé que les personnes âgées représentent la catégorie de personnes la plus à risque de contracter le virus, d’où l’importance de respecter la directive de la santé publique de rester chez soi.

Si vous avez d’autres problèmes de santé qui ne sont pas liés au virus ou n’avez pas de symptômes : appelez votre médecin de famille
François Legault a fait savoir à nouveau que les personnes qui sont malades et qui présentent des symptômes doivent appeler au 514 644-4545 pour la région de Montréal, au 418 644-4545 pour la région de Québec et au 1 877 644-4545 ailleurs au Québec. Ces gens doivent rester à leur domicile et éviter tout contact.

« Par contre, si vous avez d’autres problèmes de santé qui ne sont pas liés au virus, appelez votre médecin de famille », a exigé M. Legault. Une entente a été conclue avec les médecins de famille, qui peuvent maintenant faire des consultations par téléphone.

Pour sa part, la ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Danielle McCann, a souligné que tous les équipements nécessaires pour faire face à la pandémie, écouvillons pour les tests, masques, gants, respirateurs, visières et autres, sont disponibles et en quantité suffisante.

announcements this morning, the Québec government is announcing that Revenu
Québec will harmonize its practices with those of the Canada Revenue Agency and
postpone the deadline for paying tax balances payable for the 2019 taxation year after
August 31, 2020, both for individuals and businesses.
The Québec government announced flexibility measures yesterday for individuals and
businesses affected by the exceptional circumstance stemming from COVID-19.
By taking into account the announced federal measures, the tax filing deferrals will
allow the two levels of government to inject $16,5 billion of liquidity into the economy.
Accordingly, bearing in mind the federal announcements, Québec has adopted the
following measures.
Measures aimed at individuals
• The deadline for producing and filing income tax returns is postponed to June 1,
2020.
• For individuals and individuals in business, the deadline for applying balances
due related to income tax returns for the 2019 taxation year is postponed to
September 1st, 2020.
• For those who must pay tax instalments, the payment of the June 15, 2020 tax
instalment is postponed to September 1st, 2020.
Measures aimed at businesses

Ces derniers doivent être réservés au personnel de la santé et aux patients atteints.

Dans une vidéo publiée mercredi, le Dr Arruda invite plutôt les Québécois à se concentrer sur les consignes de prévention diffusées par le gouvernement du Québec, notamment le lavage des mains. Le masque doit être réservé aux soins afin d’éviter qu’un patient malade contamine les autres. L’usage de masques par la population à des fins de prévention risque de causer une pénurie dans le réseau de la santé.

Le gouvernement invite les Québécois à partager la vidéo sur tous les réseaux sociaux afin de sensibiliser la population à cet enjeu.

Citation :
« On me demande souvent si les gens doivent porter un masque toute la journée. La réponse, c’est que le masque n’est pas un moyen de prévention des infections dans la communauté.

they must have their clients sign. This will limit the administrative procedures to be
carried out in person.
Moreover, Revenu Québec and the Canada Revenue Agency accept the decision of

again with a view to limiting travel and contacts with the clientele. However, this
situation could change in the coming weeks, considering the postponement of the

En compagnie de la ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Danielle McCann, et du directeur national de santé publique du Québec, Dr Horacio Arruda, le premier ministre a indiqué que dans certains pays, comme la Corée et l’Italie, les jeunes ont été des agents importants de propagation du virus. Pour poursuivre ses efforts afin de limiter la propagation de la COVID-19, le gouvernement du Québec lance donc un appel à toutes celles et à tous ceux qui ont une écoute spéciale des jeunes, soit leurs idoles. Si ces personnalités publiques utilisent leurs réseaux sociaux et leurs tribunes, M. Legault est convaincu qu’elles sauront persuader les jeunes de respecter les consignes de santé publique. Le Québec en sortira ainsi gagnant.

Campagne publicitaire « Propage l’info, pas le virus »
En plus de cet appel, le premier ministre a précisé que le gouvernement du Québec lance, dès aujourd’hui, sa propre campagne de communication avec pour mot d’ordre : « Propage l’info, pas le virus ».

François Legault a rappelé aux jeunes que ce n’est pas le temps de se rassembler ni d’organiser des fêtes. C’est un effort collectif qui doit être fait pour combattre le coronavirus.

Ajout de 9 cliniques désignées, pour un total de 31
Le premier ministre a assuré que tout est fait dans le réseau de la santé pour augmenter la capacité de cueillette d’échantillons et d’analyse. Il est primordial de multiplier les tests et le nombre de cliniques, tous les jours, a insisté M. Legault. Pour y parvenir, il a annoncé que le ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux ajoutera 9 cliniques désignées, pour un total de 31 sur le territoire du Québec.

Le premier ministre a de nouveau remercié les Québécois qui ont une expérience dans le domaine de la santé et qui sont à la retraite, qui répondent en grand nombre à la campagne « Je contribue », visant à épauler le réseau de la santé. Plus de 10 000 candidatures ont été reçues à ce moment-ci et déjà 1 800 personnes sont en voie d’être mises à contribution dans le réseau.

Travaux ajournés à l’Assemblée nationale jusqu’au 21 avril
M. Legault a également salué les chefs de l’opposition à l’Assemblée nationale, Pierre Arcand, Manon Massé et Pascal Bérubé, qui font preuve de beaucoup de grandeur dans cette crise. L’unité qui règne au Québec dans cette course contre la montre est inspirante et les Québécois ont de quoi être fiers de leur classe politique.

Mardi matin, les leaders parlementaires des différents partis politiques ont convenu d’ajourner les travaux jusqu’au 21 avril, afin de permettre aux députés d’être auprès des citoyens de leur circonscription.

Respecter les directives de santé publique
Lors de son point de presse quotidien, le premier ministre a tenu à répéter les directives des autorités de la santé publique que tous les Québécois doivent suivre pour limiter la contagion à la COVID-19, aplatir la courbe de transmission et, ultimement, sauver des vies :

Se laver les mains, régulièrement, avec du savon ;
Tousser dans son coude ;
Garder une distance de 1 à 2 mètres les uns des autres ;
Éviter tous les rassemblements qui ne sont pas nécessaires, peu importe le nombre de personnes présentes ;
S’isoler pendant une période de 14 jours si on revient d’un voyage à l’étranger, sans exception, ou si on éprouve des symptômes liés à la grippe et au rhume ;
En cas de symptôme, il faut appeler le 1 877 644-4545 ;
Pour les employeurs, il faut, dans la mesure du possible, permettre aux employés de faire du télétravail. Aussi, les employeurs doivent cesser de demander des billets médicaux à leurs employés qui doivent s’isoler, afin de ne pas engorger inutilement le réseau de la santé et des services sociaux.

« L’une de nos préoccupations concerne les jeunes. Les adolescents et les jeunes adultes ne prennent pas assez au sérieux les consignes de santé publique. C’est normal, à cet âge-là, les jeunes ont moins tendance à écouter les plus vieux. Je lance donc un appel à tous les artistes, sportifs et personnalités qui ont une écoute des jeunes : utilisez vos réseaux sociaux et toutes vos tribunes pour les exhorter à respecter les consignes de santé publique et à ne pas faire la fête! De notre côté, nous lançons une campagne de communication auprès des jeunes avec pour mot d’ordre « Propage l’info, pas le virus ». Avec notre campagne, nous voulons convaincre nos jeunes de toutes les façons possibles. Nous avons une grosse bataille devant nous. Ensemble, nous sommes capables de la gagner ! »

François Legault, premier ministre du Québec

« Concernant les tests, je veux vous dire que nous sommes en train d’augmenter de façon très importante notre capacité de cueillette d’échantillons et d’analyse. Nous devons passer de centaines de tests par jour à des milliers par jour. Nous avons actuellement 22 cliniques désignées opérationnelles et il y en aura un total de 31 sur le territoire du Québec très prochainement. Notre grande priorité à court terme, c’est d’augmenter le nombre de tests. »

The measures announced Monday include redirecting all flights from Europe, Asia, South America and Africa to four Canadian airports after a weekend of disarray that saw many travellers report customs officials were not routinely providing direction to new arrivals.

Yet the government also defended its handling of the COVID-19 crisis, saying it has been adapting its response even as respiratory illness has quickly and dramatically spread around the world since first emerging in China in December.

“This situation, as we all know, has been evolving extremely rapidly,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a news conference outside his home, where he has been self-isolating since his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau tested positive for COVID-19 last week.

“We’re taking more measures, significant measures, today. I can understand people’s frustration, and that’s why we’re ensuring that there is more that will be done every step of the way to keep Canadians safe.”

The new measures will see nearly all international flights into Canada directed to the main airports in Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver starting one minute after midnight on Wednesday morning. Flights from the U.S., Mexico and the Caribbean will not be affected.

The government is also closing the border Wednesday to non-Canadians, with some exceptions. Permanent Canadian residents, immediate family members as well as diplomats, aircrew and U.S. citizens will still be allowed into the country.

Airlines are also being told to screen passengers and bar anyone from boarding a flight to Canada if they show symptoms of COVID-19. Aircrew have also been told to notify ground controllers if someone on board a plane displays symptoms and they will be met at the gate by authorities.

And the Canada Border Services Agency has started to increase the number of border agents in airports, who Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said will be on the lookout for anyone displaying symptoms as they distribute information pamphlets to all international travellers.

Automated questionnaires administered through touchscreens at entry points have also been modified to ask everyone who is arriving from overseas whether they have coughs, difficulty breathing or are feeling feverish.

New arrivals are also required to confirm that they’re being asked to self-isolate for two weeks to keep COVID-19 from spreading.

Blair acknowledged during a news conference with other federal cabinet ministers “the many questions and concerns that have been expressed by Canadians about the activities that are taking place at our border in order to screen arriving passengers.”

But he said the new restrictions on international flights as well as the ban on most foreign travellers will ease the pressure on airports and Canada’s border agents and public health officials, who are responsible for trying to keep the disease from further getting into the country.

“Important measures that have been announced today … will make the critical work of our border officers far more effective,” Blair said. “For example, by limiting international flights to our four main airports, it allows for the concentration and efficient use of our limited resources.”

The measures follow a weekend in which some travellers reported they were not being properly screened for the respiratory illness as well as images of long lines and crowded spaces in arrival areas, contrary to instructions not to gather in large groups.

Concerns about the situation at local airports _ and complaints about the federal government’s efforts to screen passengers _ have sparked some provinces and municipalities to step up their own efforts.

Hours before the federal government laid out its latest plan, Montreal city officials announced they were sending civil security and public health workers to Montreal-Trudeau International Airport to remind travellers they must self-isolate upon returning to Canada.

The measures are needed because travellers arriving in the province did not appear to be taking seriously Quebec’s order requiring two weeks of isolation, said Dr. Mylene Drouin, Montreal’s director of public health.

Travellers will pass by the employees before they leave the airport and be given information sheets and asked to note their symptoms and take their temperatures twice a day during the isolation period, Drouin said.

Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante said travellers must be made aware that upon arriving in Canada, they cannot go to work, school or anywhere else for two weeks.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney also said Sunday that he was directing provincial officials to check up on airports in the province after he visited Edmonton International Airport to investigate reports of inadequate screening of international travellers

While he didn’t address what was happening at the Montreal and Edmonton airports specifically, Trudeau said he welcomed efforts by different provinces and territories to limit the spread of COVID-19 given each “are facing different realities and risks.”

“At the same time, we also need to keep building an aligned, Canada-wide approach,” he said, later adding: “We have seen many provinces take aggressive steps to protect their communities. I want to thank them for their work. It’s time to take every precaution to keep people safe.”

Meanwhile, the union representing Canada’s border officers was set to meet with the CBSA on Monday afternoon after raising concerns last week about a lack of information and guidance to its members, one of whom has tested positive for COVID-19.

Four people in Canada have died of COVID-19, while provincial authorities had reported another 403 confirmed cases by Monday afternoon, as well as 15 presumptive cases. Ten cases have been resolved.

Le premier ministre a souligné que toutes ces personnes sont associées à un retour de l’étranger. Il n’y a donc pas de transmission communautaire soutenue pour l’instant. La situation est exceptionnelle et les décisions prises récemment changent les habitudes de vie des Québécois, a convenu le premier ministre, mais celles-ci sont nécessaires pour protéger la population.

Protéger nos personnes âgées
Le premier ministre François Legault a réitéré la recommandation selon laquelle les personnes âgées de 70 ans et plus doivent demeurer chez elles autant que possible. Les visites dans les hôpitaux et dans les centres d’hébergement et de soins de longue durée, ressources intermédiaires, ressources de type familial, et résidences privées pour aînés sont également interdites.

M. Legault a toutefois précisé que les gens peuvent sortir pour prendre une marche et que les visites pour des raisons exceptionnelles, par exemple si un de nos proches à un rendez-vous médical important ou est en fin de vie, doivent être tolérées.

Des places en garderies disponibles dès lundi pour les travailleurs en santé et en services sociaux et en services essentiels

CONSIDERING section 118 of the Public Health Act (chapter S2.2), which specifies that the Government may declare a public health emergency
in all or part of the territory of Québec where a serious threat to the health of the
population, whether real or imminent, requires the immediate application of certain
measures provided for in section 123 of the said Act to protect the health of the
population;
CONSIDERING order in council 177-2020 dated 13 March 2020,
which declares a public health emergency throughout Québec for a period of 10
days;
CONSIDERING that the said order provides that childcare centres,
day care centres, home childcare services and school childcare services must
suspend their activities, but that services must be organized and provided for a
child if one of the child’s parents is employed by, or exercises a profession in, a
health and social services institution or is a police officer, firefighter, ambulance
technician, correctional services officer or special constable;
CONSIDERING that the said order provides that the Minister of
Health and Social Services may order any other measure needed to ensure that
the health and social services network has the necessary human resources;
CONSIDERING that the said order empowers the Minister of Health
and Social Services to order any other measure necessary to protect the health of
the population, pursuant to subparagraph 8 of the first paragraph of section 123 of
the said Act;
CONSIDERING that the activities of certain courts of justice and
administrative tribunals must be maintained to rule on certain cases deemed to be

CONSIDERING that an inmate in a detention facility is entitled to
receive visits from family members and certain other persons pursuant to section
56 of the Regulation under the Act respecting the Québec correctional system
(chapter S-40.1, r. 1);
CONSIDERING that it is expedient to order certain measures to
protect the health of the population;
ORDERS AS FOLLOWS:
All places to which the public has admittance for cultural,
educational, sports, recreation or entertainment purposes, including spas, saunas,
swimming pools, amusement parks and water parks, ski stations, ice rinks, fitness
centres, sports centres, movie theatres, arcades, dance halls, zoos and
aquariums, must suspend their activities;
All bars, discotheques, restaurants offering buffet service and sugar
shacks must suspend their activities; however, restaurants that do not offer buffet
services are authorized to continue to operate, provided they admit no more than
one-half of the number of clients they can normally admit and provided they apply
measures to distance clients from one another; they may also continue activities
of the “drive-through” and “take-out” type;
In addition to the services specified in order in council 177-2020
dated 13 March 2020, childcare services must continue to be organized and
provided for a child if one of the child’s parents is employed by or exercises a
profession in the health and social services network, including in private
professional practice, community pharmacies and pre-hospital emergency
services;
The president or, in the president’s absence, the executive director
or secretary of a professional order in the healthcare field may, with no charge,
issue a special authorization during a public health emergency to a person who
has not been a member of the order for 5 years or less and is aged under 70,
allowing that person to practise an exclusive profession or use a title reserved for
the members of the order and to perform the same activities as those members;
the president, executive director or secretary may, however, limit the professional
activities, among those generally performed by members, which may be performed
by a person holding special authorization, and the conditions governing the
performance of those activities. Section 35 of the Charter of the French language
(chapter C-11) does not apply when such a special authorization is issued. A
person to whom a special authorization is issued does not become a member of 
the professional order, but is bound to respect the same rules of professional
conduct and the same rules governing the practice of the profession as a member;
A person to whom a special authorization is issued is released from
the requirement to contribute to the order’s insurance fund or join the group
professional liability plan contracted by the order if the person practises the
profession in an unamalgamated institution, an integrated health and social
services centre within the meaning of the Act to modify the organization and
governance of the health and social services network, in particular by abolishing
the regional agencies (chapter O-7.2), an institution or regional board referred to
in Part IV.1 of the Act respecting health services and social services (chapter S4.2), a public institution referred to in Part IV.2 or IV.3 of that Act, or a public
institution within the meaning of the Act respecting health services and social
services for Cree Native persons (chapter S-5). An institution or regional board that
employs a person to whom a special authorization is issued, or in which that person
practises a profession, stands surety for, defends and accepts financial
responsibility for any fault committed by the person in the practice of the person’s
profession;
A copy o each special authorization issued by a professional order
must be forwarded to the Minister of Health and Social Services;
Any hearing scheduled before a court of justice, administrative
tribunal or other administrative body must be held behind closed doors unless the
decision-making authority decides otherwise; article 13 of the Code of Civil
Procedure (chapter C-25.01), adapted as required, applies;
A member of the public may have access to the premises made
available to such a court, tribunal or body only if
(1) the person is granted access to the hearing in accordance with
the preceding paragraph; or
(2) the person requires access to a service provided in such
premises;
All visits are suspended in Québec detention facilities, except a visit
from an inmate’s lawyer;
The council and executive or administrative committee of any
municipality, metropolitan community, public transit authority or intermunicipal
board are authorized to sit behind closed doors and their members are authorized
to participate, deliberate and vote during a meeting using any means of
communication; 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the collective agreements that
apply to public service employees, a person may be reassigned to another function
or another place, as needed, even if the person’s level of employment is not
respected;
Collective and other agreements at the provincial, local or regional
level that are in effect between school boards, on the one hand, and all unions, on
the other hand, are amended as follows:
(1) the articles on personnel movements, in particular as regards
personnel substitution or replacement, assignment, reassignment or
displacement, are amended to allow the employer to assign personnel members
to the places and times where they are needed. Personnel members may therefore
be assigned to tasks under another job title, under another union certification or
with another employer;
(2) the articles on work schedules are amended to allow the
employer to meet needs;
(3) the articles on the granting of remuneration or compensation that
is additional to the remuneration or compensation paid for normal work hours and
overtime when services must be maintained, in particular by reason of an act of
God, do not apply.

Il en a fait l’annonce lors du point de presse quotidien en compagnie de la ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Danielle McCann, de la ministre responsable des Aînés et des Proches aidants, Marguerite Blais, et du directeur national de santé publique, Dr Horacio Arruda.

La mise en place de cette mesure exceptionnelle permettra au gouvernement du Québec de se donner tous les moyens nécessaires pour agir, par exemple de procéder sans délai à l’achat de tout matériel ou de conclure tout contrat pour protéger la santé de la population.

Nouvelles mesures
Le premier ministre François Legault a également annoncé une nouvelle série de mesures visant à freiner la propagation du virus.

Le premier ministre a déclaré que, dorénavant, les visites régulières dans les centres hospitaliers, les centres d’hébergement de soins de longue durée (CHSLD), les ressources intermédiaires, les ressources de type familial ainsi que les résidences privées pour aînés sont interdites sur tout le territoire québécois. Cette mesure vise à protéger les personnes les plus vulnérables. De plus, il est recommandé aux personnes âgées de 70 ans et plus de rester chez elles et de limiter leurs déplacements afin d’éviter de s’exposer au coronavirus, sauf en cas de situations exceptionnelles comme des rendez-vous médicaux importants.

Le premier ministre a aussi statué qu’à compter d’aujourd’hui, les services de santé fournis par des moyens de télécommunication, par exemple par un médecin qui fait une consultation par téléphone, seront assurés par la Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec. Aussi, les infirmières, les médecins ou les pharmaciens à la retraite prêts à donner un coup de main n’auront pas à payer de nouvelles cotisations aux ordres professionnels.

Finalement, la consigne d’annuler les rassemblements intérieurs de 250 personnes ou plus devient obligatoire.

François Legault a profité de son point de presse pour remercier à nouveau toutes les personnes (médecins, personnel infirmier, pharmaciens, ambulanciers, préposés) qui œuvrent dans le domaine de la santé et qui sont mobilisées depuis le début de cette crise.

Tout le gouvernement du Québec mobilisé
Le gouvernement du Québec dans son intégralité est au travail et est animé par un sentiment d’urgence, a assuré François Legault. Le premier ministre a rappelé que son équipe économique est en train de mettre au point les programmes d’aide temporaire pour les travailleurs et entreprises touchés. Ses ministres de l’Éducation et de la Famille sont à l’œuvre pour organiser les services de garde pour les parents qui travaillent en santé et dans les services essentiels.

La ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Danielle McCann, entend accélérer la cadence au cours des prochains jours pour ouvrir d’autres cliniques désignées pour le traitement et le dépistage de la COVID-19. Actuellement, 7 cliniques désignées sont ouvertes et 12 seront ajoutées, pour un total de 19. Le réseau de la santé et des services sociaux prend toutes les mesures nécessaires pour affronter une vague importante au cours des prochaines semaines pour le dépistage du virus.

Les Québécois doivent cesser de voyager à l’étranger
François Legault a demandé aux Québécois de cesser de voyager à l’étranger. Il est primordial de limiter le plus possible les déplacements à l’étranger, peu importe le pays de destination.

Pour ce qui est des frontières, le gouvernement fédéral doit agir avec encore plus de force. M. Legault a insisté sur la nécessité de contrôler l’état de tous les visiteurs et d’en assurer un suivi.

In a press scrum Wednesday morning, Premier Francois Legault said his government was preparing to issue a directive to hospital staff ordering them to give up travelling abroad, whether for professional or personal reasons.
In addition, school administrators will be asked to cancel school trips planned for countries at risk, including Italy and China. The list of these countries where the coronavirus is prevalent will be made public.

The holding of large gatherings, whether sporting or cultural, has become another subject of concern in Quebec. For the moment, directives will not be targeting local events, but international events will now be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they should be cancelled or not.

In total, there have been seven people who have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in Quebec.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 11, 2020.
He also recommends that students who have returned from a school trip to a country at risk be forced to quarantine themselves for two weeks, whether or not they have symptoms.",

As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is evolving daily, the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning has been reviewing the situation with education authorities and considering impacts to student travel. 

A decision was made this morning to cancel all Public Schools Branch sanctioned school trips to Europe for the March Break period, as well as all school-planned travel abroad for the rest of March. There are currently no international trips planned for the French Language School Board.

“We appreciate that Islanders are concerned, including our students, their families and staff. Our school boards have been working closely with the Chief Public Health Office to keep our staff, students and their families informed about COVID-19. The decision to cancel school trips by the Public Schools Branch was not made easily. We know that students were looking forward to the experience; however, their safety always comes first.”

- Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers

The Public Schools Branch will continue to review future student travel opportunities at an appropriate time, including rescheduling trips planned for this month that have been cancelled, and will communicate with impacted students and parents. Approximately 100 students and staff have been impacted by the cancellation of school-planned trips this month. 

Island families and students planning personal trips over March break encouraged to visit the province’s website for up-to-date important information about COVID-19, including updates and instructions for those traveling.

The individual who tested positive for COVID-19 is a woman in her fifties living in Queens County who recently returned from cruise travel. She is experiencing mild symptoms and is doing well at home. 

It is strongly recommended to that Islanders follow the advice of the Chief Public Health Office and: 

self-isolate for 14-days following out-of-country travel, whether experiencing symptoms or not. This includes teachers, students and health care workers. 
cancel all non-essential travel outside of country. 
reconsider attending social gatherings where a 2-meter distance between people is not possible, especially if elderly or immune-compromised people are present.
Dr. Morrison clarified that the recommendation to self-isolate for two weeks following out-of-country travel applies to individuals who have returned from travel effective March 8, 2020, onward. 

She also elaborated that essential travel means the movement of goods and the transportation of people across borders. This would apply to individuals such as truck drivers and airline crews. These individuals can continue their daily activities, including work; however, it is important that self-monitor daily. They should self-isolate and call 8-1-1 if they begin to experience symptoms. 

If the person self-isolating is not showing symptoms, those living with them can continue daily activities as normal and follow good hygiene practices. If the person self-isolating is experiencing symptoms, those living with them should also self-isolate and monitor their symptoms until test results are confirmed.

The special cabinet committees are focused on responding to the community and economic challenges being created by COVID-19, ensuring that Islanders, workers and industries are supported during this challenging time and that the delivery of government’s essential services are maintained. 

The three special cabinet committees announced today are: 

Economy and Business Supports: Chaired by Minister Matthew MacKay, other members include Minister Darlene Compton, Minister Steven Myers and Minister Jamie Fox. 
Labour and Social Supports: Chaired by Minister Ernie Hudson, other members include Minister Brad Trivers, Minister Natalie Jameson, Minister Bloyce Thompson and Minister James Aylward.

“As a government, we are working across departments and with our agencies and community partners every day to ensure that we have a coordinated and responsive approach to addressing COVID-19,” said Premier King. “This is first and foremost a public health priority, and containing the virus and protecting Islanders is paramount; however, we also need to continue with our efforts to address the community and economic impacts of this situation in a meaningful way.”

This is in addition to the provincial COVID-19 situation response table which has been operational for the past two weeks.

Children who have travelled outside the country, or whose parents/caregivers have travelled outside the country, should not attend childcare centres and are asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Children who are showing any sign of illness should also not attend child care centres. 

Marion Dowling, Health PEI’s COVID-19 response lead, also noted that Health PEI, as part of activating its pandemic plan and reflecting staffing pressures across the health care system, will be moving to delivering essential services only. For some Islanders, this will mean that their elective procedure or appointment will be rescheduled to a later date, some services will be offered via home-based programming or generally deferred.

“Our economy runs through the hard work and perseverance of Islanders,” said Premier Dennis King. “We need to ensure they can weather this challenging time. Together, we are prepared to recover as quickly as possible.”

 



 

Earlier today, the federal government announced $27 billion in direct support for people and businesses. The Province of Prince Edward Island will continue to work with our federal counterparts to make sure all workers and self-employed have the supports they need to get through this crisis.

“Every day, Island businesses are having to make difficult decisions with respect to their operations and our government is putting measures in place to respond quickly to meet their needs,” said Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture, Matthew MacKay. 

New supports announced today by the Province of Prince Edward Island include:

deferring all scheduled loan payments for clients of Finance PEI, Island Investment Development Inc., and the PEI Century Fund for the next 3 months;
providing $4.5 million to Community Business Development Corporations across the province to deliver financing to small business and entrepreneurs; and 
a temporary allowance of $200 per week for anyone who has experienced a significant drop in their working hours.
To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the health and safety of our Island children, the Chief Public Health Officer announced earlier this week the closure of provincially licensed early childhood centres. Today, Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning, Brad Trivers provided greater detail on how the province will support early childhood educators, child care operators and parents. 

“The supports we are extending to those impacted will help alleviate some of the financial pressure families and workers are feeling. As we move forward together in this, Islanders can expect that government will be alongside with you to support you,” said Minister Trivers. 

We will be supporting licensed operators by ensuring:

all child care spaces are maintained;
staff are eligible for employment insurance benefits; 
provincial operational grants and subsidies are continued; and
the ability to apply for business support grants is provided. 
Additionally, emergency child care services will be available to essential workers who have no other alternative during this pandemic. 

If you are an essential service worker with children and require child care, please fill out the online form survey at Emergency Child Care Services.

“I want to thank Islanders for following the advice of our health professionals and self-isolating, but we recognize the importance of personal connections, being active, and social support is essential, especially during this difficult time."" 

- Premier Dennis King. 

The provincial government is providing $10,000 to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island to provide computer tablets to Island seniors in long-term and community care facilities, allowing them to stay connected with friends and family during this isolation period. 

Amid closures of government buildings, as precautions have been taken in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19, social assistance supports continue to assist Islanders who need them.  

“Self-isolation has a significant impact to our Island seniors,” said Social Development and Housing Minister Ernie Hudson. “It is important for seniors and their family members to find new ways to maintain social connections with each other, friends and loved ones.”

Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward acknowledged the exceptional leadership and grace of Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison in guiding the public health response to COVID-19, along with the efforts of all essential workers, including health care providers. He further spoke to the efforts of Health PEI recruit other health care professionals to assist in delivering essential services. 

“In these difficult times, our health care professionals are going to work each day, putting the needs of their patients and Islanders above all else. On behalf of Islanders, I cannot thank you enough,” said Minister Aylward. “As Islanders, we want to help in any way we can and we recognize that there are many retired and qualified health care professionals who are offering to assist our front-line staff getting through this pandemic safely.”

As part of the provincial response, Health PEI is asking that any retired or otherwise qualified health care staff such as nurses (NP, RN, LPN), clinical staff, volunteers, and physicians of all specialties want to assist during PEI’s COVID-19, to contact (902) 368-4927.

Minister Aylward also encouraged Islanders to connect to a new online initiative through go!PEI and community fitness leaders called Live at Home to help Islanders remain active at home. Live at Home offers a variety of free online resources to help Islanders to stay healthy from the comfort of their home. Workouts include cardio, strength training, yoga, and low-impact for older adults or those just getting started. 

There are 10 live sessions per week planned between now and April 12, 2020, offered at either 10:00 am and 7:00 pm daily. Islanders can access the workouts and view the weekly schedule by visiting the Go!PEI Facebook page(link is external).

We are going to get through this, together.”

- Premier Dennis King

To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the health and safety of our Island children, the Chief Public Health Officer announced earlier this week the closure of provincially-licensed early childhood centres and public schools.  

“Early learning and formal education are important to all Islanders, as is ensuring that their opportunities for this is lost during this unique and difficult time,” said Education and Lifelong Minister Brad Trivers. “We’ve been working closely with the Early Childhood Development Association, school branches and staff to identify ways in which we can support Island student, families and educators during these trying times.”

Today, Education and Lifelong Learning Minster Brad Trivers provided greater detail on how the province will support early childhood educators, child care operators, children and parents. New early learning and education supports announced today by the Province of Prince Edward Island include:

Establishing a fund of up to $2 million to support early learning centres and their staff, maintain child care spaces and ensure parents do not pay fees during the period of closures; 
Suspending repayments for provincial student loans for the next six months; and
Providing home learning activities for students for the duration of the confirmed school closures through the Public School Branch (PSB) and La Commission scolaire de langue française (CSLF) websites.
Beginning Monday, March 23, students, parents and guardians can access the home learning activities by visiting the Public Schools Branch or the Commission scolaire de la langue française websites. 

This afternoon, Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew MacKay also provided more details on the Emergency Relief Worker Assistance Program. Employers will be filling out the application to help identify their workers who have experienced a significant reduction in their work hours.

“Originally, when the program was announced, it was $200 per week, but we’ve increased that amount to $250 per week as we’ve realized this income would be subject to payroll deductions,” said Minister MacKay. “We want to keep our promise that $200 will be going directly into Islander’s pockets, so we made that increase to reflect the impact of payroll deductions.”

Once the employer’s application is approved, this temporary financial support will be provided directly to affected workers through their employers and their regular payroll process. More details and how to apply the Emergency Relief Worker Assistance Program will be available on the provincial government website on Monday.",

Prince Edward Island has two confirmed positive cases of COVID-19. There have been 240 tests conducted, of which 167 are negative and 71 are still pending. 

Dr. Morrison shared additional details regarding the Island’s second case of COVID-19. The flight the man was on was Air Canada flight 7564 which travelled from Toronto to Charlottetown on March 11. Passengers on the flight are asked to self-isolate for the remaining 14 days from when they returned and monitor their symptoms. 

Islanders who are not self-isolating are encouraged to consider blood donation if they are feeling well and have not travelled internationally. Keeping up with the demand of Canada’s national supply of blood products is very important. Islanders should take the online eligibility quiz before making an appointment. Appointments must be made in advance by visiting www.blood.ca(link is external) or by calling 1-888-2-donate, to allow for social distancing.

Environmental Health Officers will now be stationed at the Charlottetown airport to pass out self-isolation information sheets to travelers as they land. These sheets are available in English and French. 

Dr. Morrison stressed the importance that children get outside to play and stay active, but they should do so while respecting social distancing. Children should participate in activities with supervision, but should not play in groups or have sleepovers. Children can get sick and spread the virus to others too. 

Dr. Morrison asks that Islanders refrain from stock piling medications, as this can lead to a shortage of medications for those who need them. Speak with a pharmacist about accessing a reasonable supply of medication. If you are experiencing symptoms, please do not go into your pharmacy.

The recently established Premier’s Economic Recovery Council, a strategic business working group made up of individuals from across business sectors, will leverage the experience, knowledge and ingenuity of the business community to advise the Premier on the issues being faced by the business community and opportunities as the province looks down the road to economic recovery. 

“We want to work closely with businesses – those who drive our economy and have been responsible for our recent economic strength as a province – so that we are doing everything we can to minimize the economic impacts of COVID-19 on our province and looking to the future when we can set a course for recovery and return to normal,” said Premier King.  

The initial Council held its first virtual meeting on Saturday and will continue to meet as required through the duration of the pandemic. The Council will consult broadly with other businesses and across all business networks as part of the “all-hands-on-deck” model. 

As part of government’s efforts to support this initiative, the Premier also launched PEI Sourced Solutions, an online portal to help Island residents and businesses meet the challenges of the pandemic, including the need for medical supplies, virtual care services, or to share ideas on how the province can help businesses and industries weather the impacts of COVID-19. 

“Islanders are innovative and resourceful, and we continue to see them stepping up to support each other during this unimaginable time. The new online portal will help connect provincial efforts and community supports so that we are ready and able to respond to the continued needs of our province going forward. It’s by working together that we will get through this,” added Premier King. 

PEI Sourced Solutions identifies the province’s potential supply challenges and important services required to support communities. Through the portal, Islanders – individuals and businesses – will be able to identify opportunities for government to procure required goods and services, as well as share creative solutions on how to direct resources and explore new ways of doing business to support COVID-19 specifc needs. The province will review all submissions and work with individuals and businesses to provide solutions. 

Islanders can access the online portal at www.princeedwardisland.ca/sourcedsolutions starting March 31 at 8 a.m.",

Starting April 6, teachers will be taking the lead on home learning activities for their students. A variety of online and printed home learning materials will be provided so that regardless of access to the internet, families and students can still practice skills and continue learning.

Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning Brad Trivers also announced that as a result of prioritizing the home learning program, a decision was made to cancel all provincial assessments for this year including the DELF French language skills assessment and the Early Years Evaluations which assess readiness for kindergarten.

This is in addition to support from Pure Kitchen, Island food banks and community organizations currently supporting food insecurity for families.

Beginning this week, nutritious prepared meals and snacks will be provided to families who register for support.  Families are asked to contact the Support for Families lines at 902-368-5155 or email supportforfamilies@edu.pe.ca(link sends e-mail).

Child care service for essential workers is planned to begin by the end of this week and will continue to roll out over the coming weeks.

The department has been working with the Early Childhood Development Association, its centre directors and staff and the Chief Public Health Office to ensure health and safety protocols are in place for centres that will be opening. 

“I want to thank our partners for their continued collaboration and coordination to support the best outcomes for children, families and teachers at this time of uncertainty,” Minister Trivers. “Our main priority remains the health and well-being of children and families and we will continue to look at ways we can address gaps to ensure that all Islanders have the necessary tools and resources available so that families can thrive.”

The Province of Prince Edward Island encourages children and youth to call the Kids Help Line if they need help. Kid’s Help Phone provides 24/7 professional counselling, information, referrals and text-based support for young people in both English and French. The number is 1-800-668-6868.",

The three new cases are all related to international travel. One is a male in his 20s, and the other two are females, one in her 30s and one in her 40s. All three are at home doing well and each self-isolated immediately upon return.

After a written warning was issued by a Conservation Officer yesterday, Summerside Police followed up and issued a ticket to an individual this morning for failing to self-isolate. This is the first fine issued in Prince Edward Island for not complying with the Public Health Order.

Dr. Morrison says anyone looking to visit their summer homes or cottages in PEI should consider waiting until the end of May. She also reminded that no in-person, faith-based gatherings should occur in PEI.

Marion Dowling, Health PEI’s Chief of Nursing, Allied Health and Patient Experience, says Health PEI is sourcing Personal Protective Equipment from vendors locally and around the world. She says Health PEI has the supplies to meet the immediate need and it remains very important to maintain and conserve the supply.

Cough and Fever Clinics and drive-thru testing clinics are now running in Charlottetown and Summerside. Appointments to the cough and fever clinics are through referral from family physicians, nurse practitioners or through 8-1-1 for those without a family doctor. Patients who require a test for COVID-19 should call 8-1-1.

Dowling explained that anyone who lives in a long-term-care facility is being closely monitored and will be a priority for testing for COVID-19 if any symptoms are identified.

Islanders experiencing symptoms (cough, fever, or shortness of breath) should call 8-1-1 to be screened and, if necessary, directed for testing. Those requiring immediate medical attention should call 9-1-1.

Protection Plan to provide extra support and relief to homeowners and 
businesses, and to enhance health preparedness for new medical equipment
 and shelter space in the fight against COVID-19, Premier Brian 
Pallister announced today.

        

        “Our government’s number one priority during this global pandemic is 
keeping Manitobans safe and ensuring our health-care system is there for
 us and our loved ones,” said Pallister.  “We must protect our most 
valuable service – our health-care system – and protect our most 
vulnerable people, our senior citizens, our homeless, those faced with 
threats of violence and those who are facing new financial challenges.”

        

        Faster Health Equipment Procurement

        

        The government is investing more than $100 million to accelerate the 
pace at which Manitoba is procuring essential medical supplies and 
equipment, hotel capacity and other critical needs to help prepare for 
COVID-19.

        

        “Manitobans have always risen to the challenge and what we’ve seen so 
far during this pandemic is no exception,” said Pallister.  “This 
$100-million investment will allow us to support made-in-Manitoba 
products and solutions from local businesses to quickly help in our 
collective efforts to fight COVID-19 and protect Manitobans in the weeks
 and months ahead.”

        

        Manitoba manufacturers or businesses that are prepared to rapidly scale
 up production or re-tool manufacturing lines to develop products made 
in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19 can go to the portal 
at www.manitoba.ca/covid19, and then visit the business and workplace page.

        

        The province is also issuing a call to businesses who have a stock of 
personal protective equipment.  If the equipment is not being used due 
to closures and physical distancing, they can also reach out by visiting
 the portal at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

         

        In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective 
equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable 
condition.  For more info, visit: https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.

        

        Cash Flow Tax Relief

        

        Today’s measures will provide immediate relief to Manitobans facing 
financial challenges by deferring provincial fees and charges, the 
premier noted.

        

        As part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, the province is providing the 
following protections for the next six months until Oct. 1:

        •    instructing Manitoba Hydro, Centra Gas and Manitoba Public 
Insurance (MPI) to not charge interest or penalties in the event that 
Manitobans are unable to pay at this time;

        •    instructing MPI to relax ordinary practices on policy renewals and collections;

        •    instructing Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries not to charge interest 
on receivables from restaurants, bars and specialty wine stores;

        •    supporting Workers Compensation Board (WCB) to do the same and 
asking WCB to extend relief from penalties for late payments;

        •    directing Manitoba Hydro and Centra Gas to not disconnect customers during these times; and

        •    working with municipal partners to ensure municipalities do not 
charge interest on provincial education taxes and school division fees 
and the province is encouraging municipalities to do the same with 
respect to their own taxes and will start discussions to support 
implementation.

        

        The government is also deferring provincial income tax and corporate 
income tax filing deadlines and payments to coincide with the current 
revised federal deferral of income tax to Aug. 31 and has indicated it 
would be willing to extend these deferrals until Oct. 1, should the 
federal government agree, the premier added.

        

        The new measures are in addition to the recently announced two-month 
deferral for small businesses that remit up to $10,000 in Manitoba 
payroll tax or $10,000 in sales tax.  This will result in $80 million in
 deferred remittance to the province.

        

        Pallister also announced plans to help make insurance more affordable 
for Manitobans.  While the province has no ability to allow for 
deferrals of payments or the waiver of interest charges and penalties, 
Manitoba is taking steps to make home and business property insurance 
more affordable to Manitobans by accelerating the removal of $75 million
 of annual PST from residential and business properties, effective July 
1.  

        

        This will save residential property owners an estimated $38 million per year and business property owners $37 million a year.

        

        Expanded Shelter Capacity  

        

        The Manitoba government will add more than 140 new shelter beds to 
support people affected by homelessness and allow for social distancing 
protocols as part of the province’s broader Manitoba Protection Plan 
response to COVID-19, the premier announced.

        

        “While many of us have the capacity to shelter at home, the reality is 
some of us do not,” said Pallister.  “Through our Manitoba Protection 
Plan, our government will ensure people who don’t have a stable home 
have a place to stay safe and healthy as we respond to the COVID-19 
pandemic together.”

        

        Up to $1.2 million will be invested at several locations in Winnipeg to:

        •    repurpose a vacant Manitoba Housing building on Sargent Avenue to create 31 new beds;

        •    add 35 beds provided by the Salvation Army at its Martha Street location;

        •    expand Siloam Mission’s capacity by 50 beds; and

        •    move individuals currently using the Salvation Army’s SonRise 
Village to alternate locations, making its 26 beds available for new 
clients.

        

        The beds at the Sargent Avenue location will be managed by Main Street 
Project, which is partnering with other shelters to co-ordinate access 
among their clients.  This location will open today and others will 
become available as soon as possible.

        

        The provincial building on Sargent Avenue may also be used as self-isolation units for homeless individuals who need it.

        

        The premier noted the province is also looking into additional options 
to support homeless and vulnerable people outside of Winnipeg as part of
 the province’s Manitoba Protection Plan response to COVID-19.

        

        “Our government remains committed to looking at every possible way to 
help all Manitobans through these uncertain times, by providing 
financial relief and support needed on the front line as we face this 
global pandemic together.”

        

        The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief 
provincial public health officer in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols.

        •    working with municipal partners to ensure municipalities do not 
charge interest on provincial education taxes and school division fees 
and the province is encouraging municipalities to do the same with 
respect to their own taxes and will start discussions to support 
implementation.

        

        The government is also deferring provincial income tax and corporate 
income tax filing deadlines and payments to coincide with the current 
revised federal deferral of income tax to Aug. 31 and has indicated it 
would be willing to extend these deferrals until Oct. 1, should the 
federal government agree, the premier added.

        

        The new measures are in addition to the recently announced two-month 
deferral for small businesses that remit up to $10,000 in Manitoba 
payroll tax or $10,000 in sales tax.  This will result in $80 million in
 deferred remittance to the province.

        

        Pallister also announced plans to help make insurance more affordable 
for Manitobans.  While the province has no ability to allow for 
deferrals of payments or the waiver of interest charges and penalties, 
Manitoba is taking steps to make home and business property insurance 
more affordable to Manitobans by accelerating the removal of $75 million
 of annual PST from residential and business properties, effective July 
1.  

        

        This will save residential property owners an estimated $38 million per year and business property owners $37 million a year.

        

        Expanded Shelter Capacity  

        

        The Manitoba government will add more than 140 new shelter beds to 
support people affected by homelessness and allow for social distancing 
protocols as part of the province’s broader Manitoba Protection Plan 
response to COVID-19, the premier announced.

        

        “While many of us have the capacity to shelter at home, the reality is 
some of us do not,” said Pallister.  “Through our Manitoba Protection 
Plan, our government will ensure people who don’t have a stable home 
have a place to stay safe and healthy as we respond to the COVID-19 
pandemic together.”

        

        Up to $1.2 million will be invested at several locations in Winnipeg to:

        •    repurpose a vacant Manitoba Housing building on Sargent Avenue to create 31 new beds;

        •    add 35 beds provided by the Salvation Army at its Martha Street location;

        •    expand Siloam Mission’s capacity by 50 beds; and

        •    move individuals currently using the Salvation Army’s SonRise 
Village to alternate locations, making its 26 beds available for new 
clients.

        

        The beds at the Sargent Avenue location will be managed by Main Street 
Project, which is partnering with other shelters to co-ordinate access 
among their clients.  This location will open today and others will 
become available as soon as possible.

        

        The provincial building on Sargent Avenue may also be used as self-isolation units for homeless individuals who need it.

        

        The premier noted the province is also looking into additional options 
to support homeless and vulnerable people outside of Winnipeg as part of
 the province’s Manitoba Protection Plan response to COVID-19.

        

        “Our government remains committed to looking at every possible way to 
help all Manitobans through these uncertain times, by providing 
financial relief and support needed on the front line as we face this 
global pandemic together.”

        

        The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief 
provincial public health officer in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols.

        The government is investing more than $100 million to accelerate the 
pace at which Manitoba is procuring essential medical supplies and 
equipment, hotel capacity and other critical needs to help prepare for 
COVID-19.

        

        “Manitobans have always risen to the challenge and what we’ve seen so

to closures and physical distancing, they can also reach out by visiting
 the portal at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

        Cash Flow Tax Relief

        

        Today’s measures will provide immediate relief to Manitobans facing 
financial challenges by deferring provincial fees and charges, the 
premier noted.

        

        As part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, the province is providing the 
following protections for the next six months until Oct. 1:

        •    instructing Manitoba Hydro, Centra Gas and Manitoba Public 
Insurance (MPI) to not charge interest or penalties in the event that 
Manitobans are unable to pay at this time;

        •    instructing MPI to relax ordinary practices on policy renewals and collections;

        •    instructing Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries not to charge interest 
on receivables from restaurants, bars and specialty wine stores;

        •    supporting Workers Compensation Board (WCB) to do the same and 
asking WCB to extend relief from penalties for late payments;

        •    directing Manitoba Hydro and Centra Gas to not disconnect customers during these times; and

        •    working with municipal partners to ensure municipalities do not

1817,2020-04-02,,Canada,Manitoba,,Call for licensed child-care providers to re-open to provide support for children of healthcare providers.,Public Announcement,Healthcare Workers,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/?archive=&item=47377,"Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living",,Government Website,MANITOBA CALLS ON CHILD-CARE PROVIDERS TO HELP OUR HEROES FIGHT COVID-19,"The Manitoba government wants to thank all child-care providers that 
have stepped up to provide care to the children of health-care and other
 emergency services workers, and is calling on all child- care providers
 to help the heroes who are on the front line during the COVID-19 
pandemic, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

        

        “The early childhood educators and child-care centres that have stepped
 up to provide child care to health-care and other emergency services 
workers are truly heroes helping heroes, and I want to thank them for 
stepping up during this difficult time,” said Stefanson.  “There are 
still health-care and other emergency services workers who need child 
care, and today I want to call on child-care providers throughout our 
province to help those workers as they provide needed services during 
this pandemic.”

        

        As of March 31, more than 1,200 children of health-care and other 
emergency services workers have been matched with an available space.  
To support centres so they can re-open during this critical time, the 
minister noted the first quarter of the provincial operating grant, 
amounting to nearly $30 million, started flowing to all licensed 
child-care centres as of April 1.  Licensed child-care facilities that 
want to help by re-opening or continuing to have spaces available should
 notify the province by emailing cdcinfo@gov.mb.ca.

        Last month, the government also announced new programs to expand home 
and community-based child care, including an $18-million grant program 
to help early childhood educators begin independently offering 
child-care services at their homes or in the community, administered by 
the Winnipeg and Manitoba chambers of commerce.  The chambers will also 
offer business mentorship to early childhood educators looking to open 
up their homes or other locations in the community to provide child 
care.  Early childhood educators can apply for the grant by filling out 
the Temporary Child Care Service Grant Form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/temporary-child-care-service-grant/.

        

        “It is not too late to step up and help out, whether you are operating 
in a child-care centre or in your own home,” said Stefanson.  “Our 
government is providing financial support to child-care centres and 
early childhood educators during this difficult time, and we will 
continue to support the child-care sector so that we can help ensure 
health-care and other emergency services workers can continue working 
during this pandemic.”

        

        All child-care centres have also been asked by the province to 
reimburse parent fees if care has not been provided and to not charge 
parents to hold spots if they are not being used, the minister added.

        

        Licensed child-care centres will continue to be limited to 16 spaces to
 support social distancing and infection prevention measures based on 
the advice of the chief provincial public health officer.  Some larger 
centres with segregated rooms and separate external entrances are able 
to offer care for up to 16 children per room.  This will continue 
indefinitely in alignment with the decision regarding kindergarten to 
Grade 12 schools.

        

        “If you are a front-line health-care or other emergency services 
worker, we want to hear from you,” said Stefanson.  “Staff will continue
 working around the clock to ensure that you can get the child care that
 you need so you can continue working during this pandemic, after which 
we will be expanding service to all critical services workers as defined
 by the chief provincial public health officer.”

        

        Health-care and other emergency services workers can apply for a child-care space by filling out the request form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/GoMCovid19ESW/. 
 These parents, which include health-care providers, emergency service 
providers, corrections workers, law enforcement workers, fire and 
paramedic workers, and direct social services and child protection 
workers, should submit their request to be matched with a child-care 
spot by Wednesday, April 8, so that they can be prioritized for 
placement.  Families that have already submitted a request do not need 
to complete the form again, as the province is already working to match 
them with an available space.

        

        Beginning on Tuesday, April 14, all parents who work in critical 
services, as defined by the chief provincial public health officer, will
 be able to access child-care spaces available in licensed facilities.  
This includes support staff at hospitals and clinics, grocery store 
staff, farmers and farm workers, construction workers, bank or credit 
union employees.  Parents working in these sectors who have been unable 
to make other child-care arrangements will be able to check which 
facilities have available spaces at www.manitoba.ca/covid19 and work directly with them to receive a spot.

        

        The listing of critical services, as authorized under The Public Health Act, is available at:

been identified as of 9:30 a.m., bringing the total number of 
lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 167 at
 this time.

        

        The data also shows:

        •    five individuals are currently hospitalized including four in intensive care,

        •    11 individuals have recovered from COVID-19, and

        •    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba remains at one.

        

        Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 1,300 tests Wednesday.  As of April 2, a total of 11,327 tests have been performed.

        

        Three additional staff across two Manitoba health-care facilities have 
tested positive for COVID-19.  The confirmed cases, at Health Sciences 
Centre (HSC) Winnipeg and Betel Home Gimli are being investigated by 
public health, occupational health and infection prevention and control 
officials.  All affected health-care workers are being provided with 
appropriate direction related to self-isolation or self-monitoring, 
depending on their exposure.

        

        As a result of the positive COVID-19 case at Betel Home in Gimli, 
public health officials are also investigating a respiratory illness 
outbreak among residents there.  Nine residents showing symptoms of 
respiratory illness are being tested for the cause of their illnesses.  
This will include testing for COVID-19.  The home has implemented 
additional infection prevention and control measures to isolate affected
 patients.

        

        A change in protocol will soon require health-care workers working in 
patient care roles at facilities, including at hospitals, long-term care
 facilities, health centres, nursing stations, Access Centres and 
COVID-19 testing locations, to expand their use of procedure masks and 
other personal protective equipment (PPE).  These changes will be 
implemented over the coming days at sites across the province.  
Manitoba’s provincial COVID-19 central supply chain management is 
working with regions and facilities to identify and ship appropriate 
PPE.

        

        New screening procedures are being implemented for staff working in 
acute and long-term care facilities.  Implementation of these measures 
has begun and will involve asking staff about travel history, exposure 
to COVID-19 positive cases, any symptoms they may have and having their 
temperature taken at the start of their shift.  Staff who are required 
to come and go during the course of their shift may be re-screened upon 
re-entry into facilities and service areas.

        

        Public health is also advising that people remain within or close to 
their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within 
Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres 
could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

        

        As Manitoba’s health system continues with preparations to ensure it is
 prepared to meet the needs of patients and to ensure appropriate 
protection from COVID-19 is available to health-care workers, donations 
of the following supplies are now welcome:

        •    N95 respirators of various models and sizes, both hospital and industrial grade;

        •    surgical/procedure masks;

        •    gloves;

        •    disposable gowns; and

        •    disinfectants and cleaners.

        

        Supplies must be in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.  Expired supplies will not be accepted.

         

        For more information on donating supplies, visit https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/ or call (toll-free) 1-833-408-0101.

        

        In order to meet continued demands of Winnipeggers for COVID-19

As of Wednesday, Manitoba had 127 probable and confirmed cases, said Dr. Brent Roussin, the province’s chief public health officer.

One person has died, four people are in hospital and four have recovered.

Roussin said there are now several cases that investigations could not link to travel, confirming “early signs of community transmission.” “Now is the time to stay home. Stay home. Stay home,” said Roussin. Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 1,130 tests Tuesday. As of April 1, a total of 10,044 tests have been performed. Screening procedures will likely continue to open up in the near future, said Roussin, but for now symptomatic people who are high risk are still the focus.

Asked about Manitoba’s supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), Lanette Siragusa of Shared Health said Manitoba has supplies for weeks for some things and months for others, and more is on the way.

Should Manitoba face a shortage of PPE, she said she will disclose that fact.

As for kids, the province is holding an online Q&A for children on YouTube Thursday at 11 a.m.

Roussin announced Tuesday that a health-care worker from Selkirk Regional Health Centre had tested positive for the virus.

“New screening procedures are being implemented for staff working in acute and long-term care facilities,” said Roussin.

“Implementation of these measures will begin today and will involve all staff arriving for the start of their shift to have their temperature taken and be required to answer questions about any symptoms they have, their travel history and their exposure to positive COVID-19 cases.” Nursing help
Manitoba is allowing its nursing registrar to waive or modify registration hurdles for former nurses so more can be hired to work in local hospitals.

Health Minister Cameron Friesen and Premier Brian Pallister made the announcement Wednesday. “Resilience matters in our health-care system,” said Pallister.

“We have seen what has happened in other jurisdictions when preparation is insufficient,” said Friesen.

“I want to thank the College of Registered Nurses and their registrants for working with us to make sure we can prepare for the challenges we face and ensure the safe care of Manitoba patients.”

Former registrants of the college who want more information can visit here. This isn’t the only health-care plan happening, said Friesen, adding that the province is looking at the idea of building temporary hospitals or using other structures to handle the expected surge in COVID-19 cases over the next few weeks",

 order under The Regulated Health Professions Act to enable the 
registrar of the College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba to waive or 
modify registration requirements for former registered nurses, allowing 
them to apply for temporary registration during the pandemic on an 
expedited basis.

        

        “We know the pandemic will place additional strain on the health-care 
system, and we’re making this regulatory change to ensure former nurses 
can be called upon to bolster the number of nurses in our hospitals, 
personal care homes and clinics to provide services to patients,” said 
Friesen.  “I want to thank the College of Registered Nurses and their 
registrants for working with us to make sure we can prepare for the 
challenges we face and ensure the safe care of Manitoba patients.”

        

        Former registrants of the college seeking information on temporary registration requirements should visit https://www.crnm.mb.ca/about/covid-19. 
 In addition, application and registration fees will be waived for 
former registrants applying for temporary registration via this process.

        

        “We are thankful for the support of our colleagues in government 
enabling a more nimble response in Manitoba to the rapidly evolving 
COVID-19 pandemic,” said Katherine Stansfield, CEO and registrar, 
College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba.  “This is a great opportunity 
for former registered nurses to continue to make a contribution to the 
health of Manitobans during this critical time.”

        

        The minister noted the order will remain in place until there is no longer a serious and immediate threat to public health.

        

        “We know many former registered nurses have already contacted us 
offering support to their colleagues during this very difficult time,” 
said Friesen.  “By coming together and taking the right steps, we can 
make a real difference and help the health-care system be prepared for 
the hard work ahead.”

        

        The minister noted this step builds on other recent investments to 
support the health system including funding for research opportunities 
during the pandemic.

        

        The Manitoba government is investing $800,000 and the Canadian 
Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) is investing more than $465,000 in
 three research projects including:

        •    investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic at the University of Manitoba;

        •    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for 
COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and

        •    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.

        

        In addition, the province’s first COVID-19 clinical trial for a drug is
 underway.  The study will test if a rheumatological drug known as 
hydroxychloroquine can prevent people from contracting COVID-19.  The 
scientific trial will determine if the drug can safely be used as a 
treatment for COVID-19.

        

        People who are eligible are:

        •    people who have tested positive for COVID-19,

        •    people who live with individuals who test positive, and

        •    health-care workers who were exposed to patients with confirmed positive infection.

        

        Manitobans who meet these criteria and wish to participate in the clinical trial should visit:

been identified as of 9:30 a.m., bringing the total number of 
lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 127 at

        The data also shows:

        •    four individuals are currently hospitalized including three in intensive care;

        •    four individuals have recovered from COVID-19; and

        •    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba remains at one.

        

        Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 1,130 tests Tuesday.  As of April 1, a total of 10,044 tests have been performed.

        

        New screening procedures are being implemented for staff working in 
acute and long-term care facilities.  Implementation of these measures 
will begin today and will involve all staff arriving for the start of 
their shift to have their temperature taken and be required to answer 
questions about any symptoms they have, their travel history and their 
exposure to positive COVID-19 cases.  Staff who are required to come and
 go during the course of their shift may be re-screened upon re-entry 
into facilities and service areas.

        

        Under The Public Health Act, new public health orders announced earlier
 this week take effect today.  In addition, the chief provincial public 
health officer has clarified a public health order to ensure a better 
understanding for businesses classified as not providing critical 
services and how they are able to operate during the state of emergency.

        

        All non-exempt businesses may:

        •    continue to operate where customers can order goods online or by 
telephone; however, customers cannot attend the businesses’ premises or 
property to order goods;

        •    continue to sell goods to customers where those goods can be 
picked up ‘curbside’ or delivered to customers; however, customers 
cannot pick up goods at businesses’ premises or on its property;

        •    allow staff to attend the businesses’ premises, without a 
limitation on the number of staff, as long as staff take measures to 
keep social distancing of one to two metres apart from each other; and

        •    accept delivery of goods and may allow services, such as 
construction, repairs, maintenance and cleaning to occur at their 
premises and on their property.

        

        Additional details are available at https://engagemb.ca/.

        

        Manitoba Justice continues to take steps to reduce the spread of 
infection and enhance access to justice throughout the province.  As of 
April 2, new admissions to all adult and youth correctional centres in 
Manitoba will be handled through the Winnipeg Remand Centre (WRC).  All 
individuals coming into custody will be isolated for up to 14 days to 
help reduce the spread of COVID-19 into facilities.  Sheriff services 
will be assisting rural police agencies with transports whenever 
possible.  All in-person visits for people in Manitoba’s adult and youth
 correctional centres have been suspended including inmate programs, 
staff training and other group activities.

        

        The province is expanding the number of free phone calls for 
individuals in custody to help them maintain contact with their support 
systems.  Lawyers are encouraged to meet with clients remotely, whenever
 possible, but in-person visits with clients can continue at all 
facilities, with the exception of the WRC.  Cleaning procedures in all 
Manitoba’s correctional centres have increased significantly including 
the use of fogging equipment to disinfect large and high-traffic areas. 
 Protocols for the use of personal protective equipment are in place to 
ensure the safety of staff and inmates.

        

        As of April 2, greater access to bail hearings on evenings and weekends
 will increase the efficiency of the system, ensure timely bail and 
other hearings and limit unnecessary admissions to the WRC.  Crown 
attorneys will work on evenings, overnight and on weekends for 
consultations and hearings and to work with defence counsel on 
sentencing recommendations.  The province is also working with police 
agencies to expand remote bail hearings in the north.  The number of 
court hearings that can be held by phone will also be increased to avoid
 unnecessary transportation of people out of their communities.

        

        Public health is also advising that people remain within or close to 
their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within 
Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres 
could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

        

        As Manitoba’s health system continues with preparations to ensure it is
 prepared to meet the needs of patients and to ensure appropriate 
protection from COVID-19 is available to health-care workers, donations 
of the following supplies are now welcome:

        •    N95 respirators of various models and sizes, both hospital and industrial grade;

        •    surgical/procedure masks;

        •    gloves;

        •    disposable gowns; and

        •    disinfectants and cleaners.

        

        Supplies must be in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.  Expired supplies are not able to be accepted.

        

        For more information on donating supplies, visit https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/  or call (toll-free) 1-833-408-0101.

        

        There are 16 community testing sites in Manitoba, including seven 
drive-thru locations, with plans to open in more communities in the 
coming days.  The public is reminded that a referral to these sites is 
needed and they are not walk-in clinics.  Information on locations and 
hours of operation are available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

        

        Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19
 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at

is suspending classroom learning for kindergarten to Grade 12 students 
indefinitely for this school year to help ‘flatten the curve’ and reduce
 the impact of COVID-19 throughout the province, Premier Brian Pallister
 and Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

        

        “We must do everything we can to flatten the COVID curve and protect 
the health and well-being of all Manitobans,” said Pallister.  “The 
decision to suspend classroom learning in school indefinitely for this 
school year is the easiest decision to make because it protects our 
children and their education – it is the right thing to do.” 

        

        The suspension of in-school classes follows the province’s announcement
 on March 13 that they would be suspended at all kindergarten to Grade 
12 schools through April 10.  This new step to extend the suspension is 
being taken with the interests of students, educators and all Manitobans
 in mind, the premier noted.

        

        No student will be held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but students
 must actively engage in learning.  All students on track to graduate 
will do so.  Teachers will teach remotely, assign work, conduct 
assessments and prepare final report cards.  For students in Grade 12, 
provincial exams will be cancelled, but teacher assessments will be 
implemented.  For students in early and middle years, provincial 
assessments are complete for the current school year, but other 
assessments will continue.

        

        “The efforts and success Manitoba teachers and educators have displayed
 during this public health pandemic have been inspiring,” said 
Goertzen.  “I join all Manitobans in asking educators to continue doing 
all they can to use remote and innovative methods to teach students 
through the remainder of this school year.  Our government is asking for
 an all-hands-on-deck approach, with their assistance and with that of 
parents, caregivers, principals, trustees and superintendents for the 
benefit of all students.”

        

        Child-care centres located in schools will continue to operate under 
the current conditions set out by the chief provincial public health 
officer.  The overall plan is oriented toward the future and we will 
learn how to modernize education through our response to this situation,
 Goertzen said.  The combined efforts are geared toward the reopening of
 classrooms, as well as toward multifaceted ways to teach and to learn 
after COVID-19, he added.

        

        The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief 
provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage
 in good social distancing protocols, including practising the 3Ps – 
protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.

        “These decisions are not easy ones, but they must be made during this 
global pandemic to protect the health and safety of all Manitobans,” 
said Pallister.  “These new orders will ensure critical services are 
available while taking steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our 
communities.”

        

        The chief provincial public health officer is issuing orders under The 
Public Health Act as approved by the minister of health, seniors and 
active living.  The following measures will be in place as of 12:01 a.m.
 on Wednesday, April 1:

        •    Public gatherings are limited to no more than 10 people at any 
indoor or outdoor place or premises.  This includes places of worship, 
gatherings and family events such as weddings and funerals.  This does 
not apply to a facility where health care or social services are 
provided including child-care centres and homeless shelters.  This 
remains in effect at this time under the previous health order issued on
 March 27, and will continue when this order comes into effect on April 
1.

        •    All restaurants and other commercial facilities that serve food 
are prohibited from serving food to customers in their premises.  This 
prevents eat-in dining at all facilities.  However, restaurants and 
other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or 
takeout.  If this takes place, the operator of the restaurant must 
ensure that all people maintain the appropriate social distancing from 
other customers when picking up food.

        •    All businesses that are not listed in the schedule of critical 
services that accompanies the order must close between April 1 and April
 14.

            - This closure order does not prevent these businesses from operating on a remote basis.

            - A business may accept orders on the Internet, or over the phone 
for delivery or pickup, as long as the employees are not working at the 
place of business.

            - The order does not prevent employees or others from coming into 
the business to perform repairs, to provide security services or to take
 out items from the business premises if the business is going to 
operate on a remote basis.

            - Nothing in the order restricts the operations of delivery of 
services by the federal or provincial governments or a municipality.

            - Nothing in the order restricts any activities of a publicly 
funded agency, organization or authority that delivers or supports 
government operations or services including health-care services.  This 
means the order does not affect institutions, agencies and other service
 providers who provide health-care services such as hospitals, regional 
health authorities and private agencies who provide a range of health 
services.

        •    All businesses listed in the schedule of critical services that 
accompanies the order may continue to operate.  If these business allow 
members of the public to attend the place of business, the operator of 
the business must put in place measures to ensure that appropriate 
social distancing rules are followed.

        •    The order does not affect how members of the College of Physicians
 and Surgeons of Manitoba, the College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba,
 the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Manitoba or the College of 
Midwives of Manitoba provide health-care services under the order.  Any 
other health professionals may continue to practice if they are 
providing services for a publicly funded agency, such as a government or
 a regional health authority, or a business listed under the schedule.  
In addition, health-care providers can continue to provide emergent or 
urgent care such as dental surgery.  

        •    Municipal transit services, taxis and other private vehicles for 
hire can continue to operate.  The operator of the vehicle must take 
measures to ensure there is a reasonable separation of people in a 
vehicle.  This order does not contain specific distance restrictions 
because it is hard to impose a limit in small vehicles.  The goal is to 
ensure a reasonable level of spacing between people.

        

        The order also repeals previous orders as of 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, 
April 1 so there is only one public health order in effect at a time.

        

        “We are seeing what is happening in other jurisdictions, and the time 
to act is now.  We must continue to adapt to the situation and change 
our day-to-day lives to prevent unnecessary illness and further 
tragedies in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public 
health officer.  “These measures will help us reduce the risk and 
protect all Manitobans during the ongoing pandemic.”

        

        The premier noted that a state of emergency declared by the powers set 
out in Section 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act to enable 
the province to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic remains in effect.

        

        “Manitobans have always pulled together in a time of crisis and this is
 no different,” said Pallister.  “We must continue to do whatever we can
 to support each other.”

out in Section 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act to enable 
the province to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic remains in effect.

        

        “Manitobans have always pulled together in a time of crisis and this is
 no different,” said Pallister.  “We must continue to do whatever we can
 to support each other.”

1825,2020-03-27,,Canada,Manitoba,,Increasing limit of time for employers to temporarily layoff employees before its considered permanent termination,Employment Protections,Businesses,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=47284,"Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living",,Government Website,PROVINCE ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY EXCEPTION TO EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS LAYOFF RULES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC,"The Manitoba government is adding a temporary exception to employment 
standards regulations to give employers more time to recall employees 
laid off as a result of COVID-19, Finance Minister Scott Fielding 
announced today.

         

        “The sudden economic impacts of COVID-19 are significant and we are 
addressing concerns we’ve heard from both employers and the labour force
 in Manitoba as businesses are forced to close their doors and lay off 
employees,” said Fielding.  “This measure will provide flexibility to 
employers to recall employees once work picks up again after this 
difficult time period and avoid severing their employment.”

        

        Under current employment standards legislation, employees who have been
 laid off for eight or more weeks in a 16-week period are deemed to have
 been terminated and are entitled to wages in lieu of notice.

        

        After consulting and receiving the support of the Labour Management 
Review Committee, which includes representatives of both employers and 
labour organizations, the province is making temporary amendments that 
would ensure any period of layoff occurring after March 1, 2020, will 
not be counted toward the period after which a temporary layoff would 
become a permanent termination.

        

        “We recognize these unique circumstances may require a longer layoff 
period than regulation allows, so these amendments would stop the clock 
until the state of emergency is lifted and keep employers in a position 
to quickly recall laid-off employees and ramp up business again,” said 
Fielding.  “We are committed to supporting Manitobans through the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re taking a balanced approach to help both 
employers and employees to address economic uncertainty and financial 
hardship.”

        

        This measure is temporary and specific to situations where employees 
will eventually be rehired once the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and 
economic activity picks up again, said the minister.

        

        The minister noted the province will also take steps to support workers
 and will suspend the exception when the province begins to recover 
economically.  Workers who are temporarily laid off may also have 
options to access streamlined federal employment benefits at this time.

COVID-19 have been identified as of 9:30 a.m., bringing the total number
 of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 39
 at this time.  Manitoba has also recorded its first patient death.  
Patient specific details are not being released at this time.

        

        Public health investigations are underway to determine additional 
details and to confirm the possible exposure of this/these case/cases.

        

        As authorized under The Public Health Act, the following measures will be in place, effective

        12:01 a.m. on Monday, March 30.  Public gatherings will be limited to 
no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor place or premises.  This
 includes places of worship, gatherings and family events such as 
weddings and funerals.  This does not apply to a facility where health 
care or social services are provided including child-care centres and 
homeless shelters.  Retail businesses including grocery or food stores, 
shopping centres, pharmacies or gas stations must ensure separation of 
one to two metres between patrons assembling in the business.  Public 
transportation facilities must also ensure that people assembling at the
 facility are reasonably able to maintain a separation of one to two 
metres.

        

        Other restrictions first introduced in a public health order issued on March 20 remain in effect.

        

        Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 606 tests on Thursday.  As of March 26, a total of 6,203 tests have been performed.

        

        Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including
 health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential travel. 
 This includes international travel and travel within Canada.  There 
should be no recreational, tourist or non-essential personal travel.  In
 addition, public health officials recommended that effective March 23, 
anyone who returns from international or domestic travel should 
self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days following their 
return.

        

        This recommendation does not include:

        •    the commercial transportation of goods and services;

        •    workers who live in a neighbouring jurisdiction and travel to Manitoba for work;

        •    health care workers who travel to work from outside the province;

        •    normal personal travel in border communities, including visits to a cottage.

        

        Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19
 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 
1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

        

        Additional drive-thru community testing sites opened today in Eriksdale
 at the Eriksdale Wellness Centre, 35 Railway Ave., 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
Monday to Friday and in Portage la Prairie at the Stride Centre, 245

        The community testing site in The Pas has relocated to the Royal 
Canadian Legion at 4 Veterans Way and will continue to be open Monday to
 Friday, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  This will brings the total to 15 
community testing sites including six drive-thru locations.  The public 
is reminded that a referral to these sites is needed and they are not 
walk-in clinics.  Information on locations and hours of operation are 
available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

        

        Moving forward, the province will continue to share updates on the 
total number of cases but additional patient information such as gender,
 age, and the regional health authority where they reside will be 
provided online once it is confirmed through public health 
investigation.  The province is also working to provide an additional 
breakdown of information online including the number of 
hospitalizations, home recovery and cases that are resolved.  This 
reporting is in line with reporting in other jurisdictions and ensures 
consistent, accurate data is available to the public.

 by introducing a program to help address anxiety caused by the COVID-19
 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

        

        “Pandemics bring about a high level of stress and anxiety, and the 
health and well-being of Manitobans continues to be our priority during 
this uncertain time,” said Pallister.  “Many of us are feeling concerns 
over whether we will get sick, the health of our families, the security 
of our jobs, being isolated from our loved ones and many other 
variables.  As part of our emergency response to COVID-19, we are 
introducing an easily accessible virtual option to help support 
Manitobans.”

        

        To help Manitobans experiencing mild to moderate anxiety due to 
COVID-19, the province is partnering with Morneau Shepell, Canada’s 
leading provider of technology-enabled HR services, to launch an 
internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) program free of 
charge to all Manitobans 16 years old and over.  The province will spend
 $4.5 million to provide these services to Manitobans for up to a year.

        

        Morneau Shepell launched this digital therapy program last week in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. T he new program is guided by 
professional therapists and addresses anxiety symptoms related to the 
uniquely challenging aspects of pandemics: uncertainty, physical 
isolation, caring for family and community members, information overload
 and stress management.

        

        “We know many Canadians are struggling with the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on their mental health,” said Nigel Branker, president, health 
and productivity solutions at Morneau Shepell.  “With the requirements 
to self-isolate and practice physical distancing, we are offering a 
convenient, digital program that can be accessed with any smartphone or 
tablet.  Our goal is to facilitate access and provide support to as many
 people as possible across the country.""

        

        Morneau Shepell’s national network includes thousands of therapists 
experienced in dealing with the psychological impact of various 
traumatic events.  Program participants also have access to live crisis 
counsellors who are available 24-7 if any risk of harm or crisis is 
identified.

        

        The program will be available in English and French in the coming weeks at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

        

        Pallister noted this is an additional resource to supplement a number 
of mental health organizations funded by the Manitoba government.  
Existing organizations that provide crisis support via phone, text and 
video conference will continue to provide support through the pandemic.  

        

        Lists of organizations are available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/crisis.html  and www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/addictions/index.html.

products and supplies to help efforts in the fight against COVID-19, 
Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced 
today.

        

        “The Manitoba government is working to contain and reduce the impact of
 COVID-19, and we’re taking measures to bolster the health system with 
help from the private sector,” said Friesen.  “We are soliciting for 
help to collect the supplies we need in order to guard Manitobans 
against COVID-19.”

        

        The minister noted as part of the ongoing battle against COVID-19, the 
province has, to date, invested emergency spending of almost $64 million
 in critical goods and services including personal protective equipment,
 ventilators, intravenous pumps and chest compression systems.

        

        He also introduced an online portal asking businesses to assist with 
supplying products and manufacturing what Manitobans need in Manitoba.

        

        “To help us further our efforts, our government is reaching out to 
businesses and their employees for products and supplies and those 
willing to manufacture items from scratch to assist in our efforts in 
this fight against COVID-19,” Friesen said.  “We recognize that dealing 
with this pandemic will be a marathon, not a sprint.  Support from 
Manitoba businesses with additional materials will ensure front-line 
staff have the equipment they need to protect themselves while 
continuing to provide exemplary care to patients throughout the 
province.”

        

        This initiative will remove barriers allowing Manitoba businesses and 
manufacturers to redeploy capacity towards the production of essential 
equipment like ventilators, masks and nasopharyngeal swabs. 

        

        The province has also intensified the search for 10 chest compression 
systems, which provide additional safety as the equipment removes one 
staff member from the room. The equipment will be allocated across the 
province.

        

        Products businesses can supply include:

        •    N95 respirators,

        •    surgical/procedure masks,

        •    nitrile gloves,

        •    vinyl gloves,

        •    nasopharyngeal swabs,

        •    specific types of reagent to be used in labs,

        •    gowns,

        •    hand sanitizer,

        •    cleaning supplies, and

        •    disinfecting supplies.

        

        Services Manitobans can provide include:

        •    guard/security services,

        •    nursing services,

        •    food services,

        •    laundry services,

        •    accommodation maintenance services,

        •    personal services,

        •    IT support services,

        •    pet care services,

        •    transportation services, and

        •    consulting services.

        

        “We are ahead of the curve and the goal remains to flatten it.  
Manitobans are coming together to help each other and it’s time for 
business to step up,” said Friesen.  “We continue to remind Manitobans 
of these simple but critical and effective steps:  wash your hands, keep
 your distance and stay home.”

        

        The minister noted that in addition to today’s business-focused website, the province created a new web application www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca to help those in need of assistance, postponed non-urgent eviction hearings, and will freeze rent increases.

        

        “Manitoba’s health-care system worked hard to prepare for COVID-19 and 
we are well-stocked with the items we need to keep Manitobans safe,” 
said Friesen.  “However, we recognize that our supply chain may be 
impacted going forward in this challenging time.  Manitobans have many 
skill sets and resources, and we’re encouraging you to help out our 
fellow Manitobans by proactively asking local vendors to consider 
producing or contributing supplies and services.”

        “This new online tool captures the spirit of our province, where 
Manitobans in communities across our province can always be counted on 
to step up to assist others who need help, especially in times of need,”
 said Pallister.  “The innovative tool, created by Manitobans for 
Manitobans, puts people all over the province who need assistance easily
 in contact with those nearby – while adhering to social distancing 
protocols – who want to help them.”

        

        The premier said www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca
 is an important initiative for the Manitoba government, safely matching
 volunteer and community support to needs for goods and services such as
 groceries, medication, snow-clearing and various other necessities. 
Residents in greatest need, such as the elderly, disabled and those at 
high risk of contracting COVID-19 during the current global pandemic, 
will find the application very useful, he noted.

        

        Built by Manitobans for Manitobans, the provincewide online platform 
was quickly designed and developed by North Forge Technology Exchange, a
 non-profit and team-led Winnipeg technology organization, in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic.  North Forge collaborated with others in the 
community, resulting in development of the app – the first online 
service of its kind in Canada – within five days.

        

        “There are a lot of amazing people out there creating volunteer 
platforms, but we wanted to ensure that security and safety are embedded
 to protect our citizens”, Joelle Foster, CEO, North Forge Technology 
Exchange. “As such, we turned to our community of innovators and we are 
so pleased that software development partners like Permission Click and 
ID Fusion Software stepped up to collaborate with us and have built this
 tool in record time.""

        

        The online tool www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca
 will be vital for requests ranging from home computer and data security
 assistance to prescription medication pickups and deliveries.  
Manitobans can access www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca directly or via www.Manitoba.ca/COVID19.

        

        “This is how Manitobans pull together, put their heads together and 
bring ideas to life to assist each other when help is needed,” said 
Pallister.  “Manitoba has been the home of hope for over 150 years, and 
we will continue to be the home of hope for generations to come.  We 
will get through this pandemic together.

        

        The premier added the province continues to rely on the recommendations
 of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all 
Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including 
practising following the 3P’s – protect yourself, protect your loved 
ones and protect your community.",

identified on March 19, bringing the number of lab-confirmed positive 
and presumptive positive cases in Manitoba to 18 at this time.

        

        Case 18 is a woman in her 50s who lives in Winnipeg.  At this time, the
 public health investigation indicates the case is related to travel.  
Information about flights where a person with a lab-confirmed case of 
COVID-19 had symptoms at the time of travel are updated at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/flights.html as information becomes available.

        

        Manitobans are reminded that public health orders remain in effect.  They include:

        •    limit public gatherings to less than 50 people including places of worship, family events, weddings and funerals;

        •    require retailers to ensure separation of two metres between patrons in their facility;

        •    limit hospitality premises such as restaurants or theatres to 50 
people, or 50 per cent of capacity (whichever is less); and

        •    immediate closure of bingo and gaming centres, as well as wellness centres such as gyms and fitness centres.

        

        At this time, the public health orders apply to public places, not 
workplaces.  However, workplaces should still follow good social 
distancing practices as recommended by public health including:

        •    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two 
meters/six feet) contact between other individuals in public;

        •    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;

        •    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;

        •    staying home if you are sick;

        •    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and 
self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill
 with the virus; and

        •    cancelling travel and avoiding crowded places and events, 
especially if you are at higher risk (e.g. seniors and those with 
underlying medical conditions).

        

        The online screening tool is now available in an interactive voice 
response (IVR) format.  It is not a replacement for Health Links–Info 
Santé.  It is specifically for Manitobans who prefer to complete the 
screening tool by phone rather than online.

        

        The tool asks callers standard screening questions for COVID-19.  If 
needed, it directs those who may require a conversation with a 
health-care professional to Health Links–Info Santé.  People who want to
 self-screen can call (toll-free) 1-877-308-9038.

        

        A new community screening drive-thru site has opened in south Winnipeg 
at the Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) Bison Drive Service Centre.  MPI 
employees vacated the premises, located at 15 Barnes St., earlier this 
week to make way for the testing site. 

        

        Hours for the site, Manitoba’s 11th testing location and third 
drive-thru, are daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Information on other sites 
is available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

 care to essential front-line workers who need it as they support the 
province’s COVID-19 response, Families Minister Heather Stefanson 
announced today.

        

        “This pandemic requires all Manitobans to change how they live their 
daily lives, but it is clear that we are all willing to work together to
 find solutions,” said Stefanson.  “Our government is following through 
on our commitment to parents who must provide essential front-line 
health and other services and who need help securing child care.  In 
this time of uncertainty and challenge, we are working in partnership 
with child-care providers to find creative solutions in the community.”

        

        To ensure dedicated child-care spaces are available and prioritized for
 health-care and other essential front-line workers while also following
 public health recommendations for social distancing, the Manitoba 
government will:

        •    establish a new $18-million grant program to help early childhood 
educators affected by the suspension of child-care services in centres 
to have access to immediate funds to begin independently offering 
child-care services at their homes or in the community;

        •    continue to provide licensed child-care centres with their full 
operating grants and subsidies, totaling up to $7.6 million 
provincewide, so that they can provide care for up to 16 children with 
first priority given to children of health-care and other essential 
workers;

        •    invest $2 million to create a trust that will provide capital 
grants to child-care providers to ensure safe, quality care; and

        •    encourage all centres to reimburse prepaid fees to parents for 
child care they can no longer access during this difficult time.

        

        “Manitoba’s child-care providers have clearly demonstrated their 
dedication, caring and willingness to work together as we respond to an 
unprecedented situation,” said Stefanson.  “Our government is taking 
concrete, immediate steps to help ensure child-care options continue to 
be available when they are needed most.”

        

        The province is partnering with the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce and 
the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce to administer the $18-million grant 
program.  Further details, including on how to apply, will be available 
online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19. 
 Eligible early childhood educators would each receive up to $3,000 to 
provide care to children at their homes or at other appropriate spaces. 
 Early childhood educators would also be able to individually apply for 
the grants and to choose to work together to provide care in the 
community for up to a maximum of 12 children.

        

        The $2-million fund will be administered by The Winnipeg Foundation and
 will provide grants to child-care providers with 16 or fewer children 
and to home-based providers with 12 or fewer children.  The grants can 
be used to purchase supplies for meeting health and safety requirements,
 such as a fire extinguisher or first aid kits, or to undertake minor 
upgrades to physical spaces or to provide quality learning and care 
items such as high chairs, mats or books.

        

        Further information on all of these programs will be provided online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

         

        The Manitoba government recommends that all parents continue to try to 
make their own alternate arrangements for child care.  These interim 
options should be used only when parents cannot make other child-care 
plans.  Parents who use these options will continue to pay daily parent 
fees.

        

        Child-care centres are expected to reimburse or offer credits on parent
 fees that have been collected for dates when care will no longer be 
offered.  Unless care is being provided, parent fees should no longer be
 charged as of April 1.

        

        Essential, front-line workers who need child-care options should call 204-945-0776 or (toll-free) 1-888-213-4754, or e-mail cdcinfo@gov.mb.ca.  All questions about the new funding programs available to child-care centres and early childhood educators should be sent to ecegrant@gov.mb.ca.

transportation facilities must also ensure that people assembling at the
 facility are reasonably able to maintain a separation of one to two 
metres from others assembling at the facility.

        2.    Limiting hospitality premises where food or alcohol is served or 
any theatres offering live performances of music, dance and other art

        Public health investigations are continuing on the two additional 
positive cases identified yesterday.  It appears that both cases are 
related to travel.

        

        In an effort to protect patients, staff and the community, all Manitoba
 health-care facilities will soon begin implementing enhanced 
precautions and protocols which will involve additional visitor 
restrictions.  Exceptions for compassionate reasons will continue to be 
made on a case-by-case basis.

        

        This step follows public health’s recommendation earlier this week to 
suspend visitor access to long-term-care facilities across the 
province.  Similar to health-care facilities, exceptions will be made on
 a case-by-case basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.

        

        Preparations continue to ensure acute care facilities are prepared in 
the event of COVID-19 patients requiring admissions.  Health Sciences 
Centre Winnipeg (HSC) has begun a series of moves as part of the 
provincially co-ordinated response.  A medicine unit will today be 
relocated to existing clinical space in the former HSC Women’s Pavilion 
at 735 Notre Dame Ave. to enable the movement of patients within the 
hospital campus to create a 30-bed isolation unit.

        

        Twenty-seven additional ventilators, which are crucial to caring for 
critically ill patients, have arrived and will be put into operation at 
health-care facilities throughout the province.  This brings Manitoba’s 
overall supply to 266.  It is anticipated an additional 16 ventilators, 
also ordered last week, will be delivered in the coming weeks.

        

        Agencies that offer day programs through Community Living disABILITY 
Services for adults with intellectual disabilities have been asked to 
limit this service as part of the effort to support social distancing 
efforts and reduce the potential spread of the virus.  As soon as 
possible, day services will only be offered to individuals who:

        •    live with family members who could lose their job if day services are not provided,

        •    are supported by home share providers who can’t provide care 
during daytime hours and where other arrangements are not possible, and

        •    cannot be safely supported in their residence during daytime hours.

        

        Clients and their family members or care providers will receive further information as soon as possible.

        

        Manitoba now has nine dedicated testing sites for COVID-19.  There are 
four sites in Winnipeg, as well as locations in Brandon, Thompson, Flin 
Flon, The Pas and Selkirk.  Additional locations are expected to open in
 the coming days including drive-thru locations in Winnipeg and 
Steinbach.  The new drive-thru in Winnipeg will open in the coming days 
at the Manitoba Public Insurance Bison Drive Service Centre at 15 Barnes
 St. (intersection of Barnes Street and Bison Drive) in south Winnipeg, 
while the Steinbach location will open tomorrow morning at the Community
 Health Services Building at 365 Reimer Ave.

        Licensed child-care centres will suspend services from the end-of-day 
on March 20 until April 10, based on advice from public health 
officials.  Parents are asked to begin making alternative arrangements 
for child care immediately, with the goal of reducing the number of 
children in centres as soon as possible.  This direction does not apply 
to home-based child care, as they care for a smaller number of children.
  

        

        Planning is underway to ensure parents who provide essential services, 
such as front-line health-care providers, will have a way to continue to
 access child-care options.  Families who meet this criteria and cannot 
make other arrangements should contact 204-945-0776, 1-888-213-4754 
(toll-free) or cdcinfo@gov.mb.ca as soon as possible to help support the development of this service.

        

        Public health officials are recommending the immediate suspension of 
visitors in long-term care facilities across Manitoba.  Exceptions for 
compassionate reasons or end of life will be made on a case-by-case 
basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.

        

        Additionally, it is recommended that adult day programs and similar 
programming located within long-term care or personal care facilities be
 immediately suspended.

        

        All other adult day programs may continue, provided they comply with 
the recommendations of social distancing, appropriate screening and do 
not exceed the recommended restriction on social gatherings of more than
 50 people.

        

        An eighth dedicated testing site for COVID-19 will open Wednesday in 
the Nurses Residence Gymnasium at the Brandon Regional Health Centre.  
It will be open seven days per week, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

        

        Other dedicated sites in the province include four locations in 
Winnipeg, as well as in Thompson, Flin Flon and The Pas.  More locations
 throughout the province are expected to open throughout the week.  

        

        These testing sites are by referral only and are not walk-in clinics.  
Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 
should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 
1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.

        

        Individuals who have travelled internationally in the last 14 days, 
been instructed to self-isolate or self-monitor, or have cold- or

alternate arrangements as soon as possible, even though centres will 
remain open for the remainder of the week;

        •    continuing to allow home-based child-care providers to operate; and

        •    creating dedicated child-care options for front-line and essential services staff who need them.

        

        Parents who will be providing front-line health care or are a member of
 a fire, police or paramedic service and will not be able to find 
alternative child care while services are suspended are asked to contact
 204-945-0776 or 1-888-213-4754 (toll-free).

        

        Parents are asked to keep all children and youth home if they have a 
fever or other respiratory illness symptoms.  Schools will be notifying 
parents that students will be sent home if they have any of these 
symptoms.

        

        The province is also advising that:

        •    teachers will continue to be on the job, either in schools or at 
home, to create learning plans and continue teaching using the distance 
learning options available; and

        •    all casinos will close effective midnight tonight.

        

        Public health officials are recommending the immediate suspension of 
visitors in long-term care facilities across Manitoba.  Exceptions for 
compassionate reasons or end of life will be made on a case-by-case 
basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.

        

        In addition, public health officials are recommending the cancellation 
of gatherings of more than 50 people, consistent with the announcement 
made by the federal government.

        

        Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including
 health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential 
international travel.  In addition, public health officials are 
recommending all international travellers should self-isolate and 
self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after returning to Canada.

        

        Health officials are reminding physicians, health-care providers and 
support staff returning from international travel that they MUST 
self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.

        

        To support social distancing efforts, Manitoba Health, Seniors and 
Active Living’s registration and client services office at 300 Carlton 
St. will be temporarily closed to the public.  Staff will continue to 
register people for Manitoba health coverage and Manitoba Pharmacare 
benefits through email, phone, fax and mail.  Forms and contact 
information can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/forms.html.

        

        Yesterday, Manitoba’s Provincial Court, Court of Queen’s Bench and 
Court of Appeals all introduced new provisions to restrict or reschedule
 matters over the next several weeks.  For more information, visit www.manitobacourts.mb.ca/news/covid-19-update-march-16-2020/.

        

        A new self-assessment tool is now online to help Manitobans determine 
whether they need to call Health Links–Info Santé to possibly get a 
referral or to self-isolate.  The tool provides interactive advice to 
users concerned about whether they have contracted COVID-19.  It is 
expected the tool will help with call volumes.  For more information, 
visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

        

        Additionally, people calling Health Links–Info Santé can soon expect to
 hear a new interactive voice response system (IVR).  The IVR will allow
 COVID-19 screening questions to be answered prior to users being 
connected to operators, which should shorten the length of calls.  This 
technology is anticipated to be up and running as soon as this 
afternoon.

        

        Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19
 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 
1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.  Nearly 1,700 patients
 have visited dedicated testing sites in Winnipeg and Thompson in the 
past five days including 481 yesterday.

        

        New dedicated testing sites for COVID-19 opened today at the following locations:

        •    Channing Auditorium in the Flin Flon Community Hall, 2 North Ave., Flin Flon; and

        •    Guy Hall, 28 First St. West, The Pas.

        

        Both sites will be open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday to Friday.

        

        All Manitobans should continue to practice good social distancing 
strategies including minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close 
(less than two metres) contact between other individuals in public.

Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority.  At this time, it appears 
this woman was exposed to the virus through travel.  Case seven is a 
woman in her 50s who lives in Winnipeg.  At this time, it appears this 
woman was exposed to the virus through travel.  Patient contact and 
public health investigations are ongoing.

         

        A site will open in Thompson tomorrow, Monday, March 16 to help 
determine if individuals need to be screened or tested for COVID-19.  It
 will operate daily from 9 am to 4 pm in the Thompson Clinic in the 
Plaza Mall.  Staff will also provide advice about precautions people can
 take to reduce their risk and advice about self-isolation, if 
required.  Clients who present to the site will be triaged upon arrival 
and directed for testing as appropriate. Locations of screening and 
testing sites other communities across the province are being 
confirmed.  Details will be shared once available.  

         

        Manitobans are reminded that only individuals who have recently 
returned from an international trip recently and also have a fever, 
cough or other symptoms of a respiratory illness should be tested for 
COVID-19.

address any impacts on essential services.

         

        People are encouraged to take common prevention measures including 
regular handwashing with soap and warm water for at least 15 seconds.  
Make sure to dry hands thoroughly.  Alternatively, people can use an 
alcohol-based hand cleanser if their hands are not visibly dirty.  
People should also cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when 
coughing or sneezing, or cough or sneeze into their sleeve.

        Winnipeg’s four dedicated testing sites for COVID-19 have seen 900 
patients in the past three days including 268 yesterday.  The public is 
reminded that these sites are not walk-in clinics.  International 
travellers who have developed cold- or flu-like symptoms within 14 days 
of returning to Canada should contact Health Links-Info Santé at 
204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 to be referred for testing 
at these sites.

        

        Health Links received more than 1,000 calls yesterday.  Staffing 
numbers continue to be increased and technical enhancements are being 
worked on including an online self-assessment tool that will help 
Manitobans identify whether they need to be tested for the virus.  It is
 anticipated this tool will be available in the next few days.

        

        HSC Winnipeg is restricting the number of public entrances to the 
campus beginning today, so visitors can be properly screened for 
COVID-19 upon arrival.  These restrictions will protect patients who may
 have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk of 
severe illness due to COVID-19.  Patients are now only allowed one 
visitor at a time.  Exceptions will be made at a manager’s discretion 
for special circumstances, such as visitors who require an escort or 
those going to see a patient nearing the end of their life.

        

        Similar measures are being considered for other health-care facilities throughout the province and at long-term care homes.

        

        Visitors arriving at facilities throughout Manitoba’s health system can
 expect to be screened upon arrival for COVID-19.  If visitors are ill 
or have travelled internationally in the past 14 days, or if they have 
been instructed to self-monitor or self-isolate, they are strongly 
encouraged to stay home for the well-being of staff, volunteers, 
patients and the general public.

        

        CancerCare Manitoba is asking patients with upcoming appointments or 
tests to call ahead.  Cancer patients may be more susceptible to 
COVID-19 due to weakened immune systems, so appointments and tests may 
be rescheduled if not considered urgent or patients are not actively 
being treated for the disease.

        

        Similarly, patients living with kidney disease are also at higher risk 
of infection.  Scheduled dialysis treatments are proceeding as usual for
 patients who are well.  However, dialysis patients experiencing cold- 
or flu-like symptoms who have returned from international travel in the 
past 14 days are asked to call Health Links-Info Santé at 204-788-8200 
or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 for an initial assessment.  They are also
 asked to call their renal unit before leaving home for a dialysis 
treatment or clinic visit so staff can prepare to treat them in a way 
that keeps them and others from possibly being exposed to COVID-19.

        

        In keeping with social distancing strategies outlined to Manitobans and
 in consultation with key stakeholders, public health officials have 
advised suspending classes in Manitoba kindergarten to Grade 12 schools 
effective March 23 to April 10.  This is being done to help reduce the 
spread of COVID-19 in Manitoba.

        

        Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:

        •    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support 
those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind 
in their studies;

        •    reduce activities in large groups and crowds;

        •    increase desk distance between students; and

        •    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms to reduce the 
number of people in classrooms and increase distance between staff and 
students.

        

        Public health officials continue to recommend social distancing measures for all Manitobans including:

        •    cancelling or postponing any large-scale events (events with more than 250 attendees);

        •    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;

        •    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;

        •    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;

        •    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and 
self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill
 with the virus; and

        •    avoiding all non-essential travel, as well as crowded places and events.

        

        Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps 
to ensure employees can stay home when ill, without facing barriers such
 as the requirement for sick notes, and work from home if possible.  
Employers should also discontinue non-essential, work-related travel 
outside of Manitoba and encourage virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, 
close contact between individuals.

        

        People are encouraged to take common prevention measures including

People should also cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when 
coughing or sneezing, or cough or sneeze into their sleeve.

        

        Being prepared also means using official sources for the most 
up-to-date and accurate information.  The Manitoba government is also 
urging media to exercise caution in reporting information related to the
 evolving COVID-19 situation and to avoid hearsay or speculation, as 
this can spread misinformation.

        Visitors arriving at health-care facilities may also be asked direct 
questions about their symptoms, contacts and travel history upon 
arrival.  This includes HSC Winnipeg, which will begin restricting 
access points to the campus on Sunday to ensure proper screening of 
visitors arriving at the facility can occur.

        In total, there has been one confirmed COVID-19 case in Manitoba and three presumptive positive cases.

        

        In keeping with social distancing strategies outlined to Manitobans and
 in consultation with key stakeholders, public health officials have 
advised suspending classes in Manitoba K-12 schools effective March 23 
to April 10. This is being done to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in
 Manitoba.

        

        Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:

        •    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support 
those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind 
in their studies;

        •    reduce activities in large groups or crowds;

        •    increase desk distance between students; and

        •    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms, to reduce the 
number of people in classrooms and increase distance between staff and 
students.

        

        Public health officials continue to recommend social distancing measures for all Manitobans, including:

        •    cancelling or postponing any large-scale events with more than 250 attendees;

        •    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;

        •    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;

        •    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;

        •    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and 
self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill
 with the virus; and

        •    avoiding all non-essential travel, as well as crowded places and events.

        

        Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps 
to ensure employees can stay home when ill, without facing barriers such
 as the requirement for sick notes, and work from home if possible. 
Employers should also discontinue non-essential, work-related travel 
outside of Manitoba and encourage virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, 
close contact between individuals.

        

        Being prepared also means using official sources for the most 
up-to-date and accurate information. The Manitoba government is also 
urging media to exercise caution in reporting information related to the
 evolving COVID-19 situation and to avoid hearsay or speculation, as 
this can spread misinformation.

identified in Manitoba.  In addition, Manitoba public health officials 
are recommending that Manitobans should consider taking additional 
social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

        

        Public health is updating a flight number from Vancouver International 
Airport to Winnipeg where individuals may have been exposed to 
COVID-19.  Individuals on Air Canada flight AC 8622 on March 7 and March
 8 in rows 24 to 29 are asked to self-isolate and monitor themselves for
 symptoms for 14 days since their last known contact or exposure.  For 
more information on self-isolation and self-monitoring, visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/factsheets/coronavirus_selfisolation.pdf.

        

        Social distancing measures include cancelling or postponing any 
large-scale events with more than 250 attendees.  This measure helps 
reduce prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) 
contact between other individuals in public.

        

        In addition, individuals in Winnipeg directed by Health Links–Info 
Santé to be tested for COVID-19 will be asked to visit a community 
screening location.  Two new screening sites will both open at noon 
today.

        

        One is at Mount Carmel Clinic (886 Main St.) and the other is at Access
 Transcona (845 Regent Ave. W.).  This is in addition to two other sites
 that opened on March 12 at Access Winnipeg West (at 280 Booth Dr.) and 
Access Fort Garry (135 Plaza Dr.)

        

        These four sites will serve as COVID-19 community screening sites, in 
addition to continuing with their regular operations.  Patients should 
be referred for testing to attend to the community screening locations. 
 Walk-in traffic without a referral is discouraged.

        

        Testing at these sites will be available Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 7 
p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Those who require 
screening, assessment and/or testing after hours will still be directed 
to urgent care sites and emergency departments.

        

        People living outside Winnipeg who are concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 can visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/coronavirus/ or call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for further information.

        

        Work is also underway to increase capacity at Health Links–Info Santé. 
 Staffing levels have been doubled and additional staff are being pulled
 in from other areas and trained today.  Caller options have been 
streamlined and there is now a dedicated COVID-19 number to press.  
Usual scripts have also been shortened to reduce the length of calls 
once they are answered.

        

        Public health officials continue to recommend these social distancing measures for all Manitobans:

        •    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;

        •    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;

        •    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;

 exposure history.

        

        As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, all Manitobans have a role to play in
 slowing its spread and minimizing its impact on the health-care system 
and in communities.

        

        The provincial government has developed social distancing measures to 
slow the spread of COVID-19 in Manitoba.  Information is being shared 
with key stakeholders about measures at government facilities including 
the Manitoba Legislative Building, the legislative building grounds and

social distancing strategies are now being recommended to all Manitobans
 to limit the spread of COVID-19.

        

        Those at the greatest risk of severe outcomes include those over 65 
years of age, those with underlying medical conditions and those with 
compromised immune systems.  Public health officials are also reminding 
all Manitobans to frequently wash their hands, cough and sneeze into 
their sleeves and to stay home when sick.

officials are advising Manitobans of the first presumptive positive case
 of COVID-19 in the province.

        

        A woman in her 40s who lives in the area of the Winnipeg Regional 
Health Authority has tested positive for COVID-19.  At this time, it 
appears the individual was exposed to the virus through recent travel to
 the Philippines.  The individual is recovering at home in stable 
condition.

        

        As of March 11, 403 tests have been completed for COVID-19 in Manitoba.  

        

        A pandemic has now been declared by the World Health Organization, and 
social distancing strategies are now being recommended to all Manitobans
 to limit the spread of COVID-19.

        

        Those at the greatest risk of severe outcomes include those over 65 
years of age, those with underlying medical conditions and those with 
compromised immune systems.  Public health officials are also reminding 
all Manitobans to frequently wash their hands, cough and sneeze into 
their sleeves and to stay home when sick.

        

        Social distancing strategies for all Manitobans include:

        •    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between other individuals in public;

        •    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;

        •    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;

        •    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and 
self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill
 with the virus; and

        •    considering avoiding travel, crowded places and events, especially if you are at higher risk.

            

        Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:

        •    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support 
those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind 
in their studies;

        •    reduce large-group, crowded activities;

        •    increase desk distance between students; and

        •    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms, which reduces 
the number of people in classrooms and increases distance between staff 
and students.

        

        Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps to ensure their employees can:

        •    stay home when ill, without facing barriers such as the requirement for sick notes; and

        •    work from home if possible.

        

        Employers should also consider:

        •    discontinuing non-essential work related travel outside of Manitoba; and

        •    encouraging virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, close contact between individuals.

        

        Manitobans are strongly advised to review travel plans given the 
evolving risk throughout many parts of the world and Canada.  Frequently

Minimize Spread of COVID-19: Friesen
                                

                


                                
        The Manitoba government is working with the Public Health Agency of 
Canada (PHAC), and provinces and territories, to co-ordinate a 
procurement effort of protective equipment to prepare for the 
possibility of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province, Health, 
Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

        

        “Our government, along with provinces and territories, is taking 
inventory of the personal protective equipment (PPE) currently in our 
jurisdiction, and planning for what would additionally be required in 
the event of an outbreak,” said Friesen.  “Ensuring staff throughout the
 health system have access to the equipment and supplies required for 
safe patient care and their own personal protection is a priority.”

        

        Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) is co-managing a 
provincially co-ordinated Incident Management Structure to ensure 
appropriate planning, preparation, mitigation and response to the 
evolving COVID-19 situation, the minister added.  While Manitoba has an 
adequate supply of PPE at this time, this purchase will ensure the 
province is well positioned to manage any additional demand on resources
 that would accompany potential or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 
Manitoba.

        

        Current inventory of PPE supplies is being closely monitored, and 
regions and sites have been asked to take steps to ensure supplies of 
PPE, including procedure/surgical masks and N95 respirators, are 
maintained and that providers and staff are aware of their appropriate 
clinical use.

        

        The purchase will help to ensure patients, staff, and front-line health
 workers, have appropriate protective equipment at a competitive price. 
 The determination of the volume of supplies needed is undertaken 
collaboratively with the assistance of the Public Health Agency of 
Canada.  Most personal protective equipment used in clinical 
environments will not spoil.

        

        Based on current planning assumptions, including supplies required by 
Manitoba’s regional health authorities, service delivery organizations, 
personal care homes and fee-for-service clinics, the projected cost is 
an estimated $35.2 million.

        

        PPE supplies are being utilized as health-care facilities and sites 
across the province in line with clinical recommendations.  This 
includes use by staff of gloves, gowns, procedure or surgical masks and 
face/eye protection when dealing with any patients who have flu-like 
symptoms (cough, fever, difficulty breathing).  Procedure or surgical 
masks are also provided to patients who show these symptoms, as well as 
anyone accompanying them.  

        

        Staff performing certain procedures are required to wear an N95 
respirator in addition to eye-protection, gloves and a gown.  Efforts to
 ensure staff are appropriately trained and fit-tested for the N95 are 
underway across the province.

        

        “The government and public health officials are reminding Manitobans 
the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in Manitoba remains low, but is 
increasing given events occurring in Canada and around the world.  We 
must continue to prepare for this virus in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent 
Roussin, Manitoba’s chief public health officer.

        

        The Manitoba government is working with Shared Health, Manitoba’s 
regional health authorities and service delivery organizations as well 
as the Public Health Agency of Canada to share information and best 
practices.

        

        Common personal prevention and preparedness measures for viruses such 
as COVID-19 and influenza include regular hand washing with soap and 
warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  Additional precautions 
include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and 
staying home when you are sick, regardless of recent travel.  Avoid 
close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, 
such as coughing or sneezing.

are reminding Manitobans that the risk of getting the novel coronavirus 
in Manitoba remains low.  Manitoba officials continue to work closely 
with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) to monitor the situation as it evolves.

        

        As of Feb. 5, 10 tests have been completed for the novel coronavirus in
 Manitoba.  At this time, there are no laboratory-confirmed cases here.

        

        Suspected and confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are required to be 
reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.  To date,
 five cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Canada.  All
 confirmed cases are in Ontario and British Columbia.

        

        In light of the evolving knowledge of the ongoing outbreak of the novel
 coronavirus, PHAC is recommending that travellers who have been in the 
province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, self-isolate for 14 days
 following arrival in Canada.  PHAC is also recommending that travellers
 returning from the rest of mainland China self-monitor for 14 days 
following arrival in Canada.

        

        Early evidence indicates the novel coronavirus can cause a range of 
mild to severe symptoms.  It is possible that individuals will not 
recognize when they first develop symptoms because they can be similar 
to a cold or flu.

        

        The steps to limit contact with others if you are self-isolating include:

        •    avoiding individuals with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and senior citizens;  

        •    avoiding having visitors to your home;

        •    avoiding situations such as social gatherings, work, school, daycare, health-care facilities and seniors residences;

        •    avoiding taking public transit, taxis and ride sharing;  

        •    washing your hands often with soap and warm water frequently for at least 15 to 20 seconds; and

        •    covering your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing.

        

        If recent travellers develop a fever, cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing in the 14 days following their departure from 
province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, or from the rest of 
mainland China or if they have been in contact with a case who has, and 
they are seeking health care, it is important to call ahead.  
Individuals can call to their local urgent care centre or emergency 
department or Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 
(toll-free).

coronavirus, ensuring health-care providers are aware of symptoms and 
implementing heightened precautions to detect, isolate and test for the 
virus, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen said 
today.

        

        “There have been no reported cases of novel coronavirus to date in 
Manitoba and the risk remains low at this time, but we must remain 
vigilant,” said Friesen.  “Across the health system, 911 call operators,
 first responders and front-line health-care staff have the information 
they need to identify symptoms and ensure all precautionary infectious 
disease protocols are in place.”

        

        All patients seeking care at health-care facilities for fever or 
respiratory symptoms who have travelled in the past 14 days to Wuhan, 
China – where the outbreak first occurred – or who have had close 
contact with an ill person who travelled to that region, will be 
assessed for coronavirus.  Paramedics and 911 operators have been 
directed to ask about a patient’s travel history if they are identifying
 respiratory, fever, cough or flu-like symptoms.  First responders and 
health-care workers are following existing infectious disease protocols 
to detect and prevent the spread of the virus.

        

        Suspected and confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are required to be 
reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.

health will promptly followup with close contacts to take appropriate 
precautions and monitor for symptoms.

        

        To date, two Canadian cases of the virus have been confirmed, a couple 
from Toronto that recently returned from Wuhan.  Out of an abundance of 
caution, two Manitoba patients with uncertain travel histories have been
 tested for novel coronavirus in recent days.  Both tested negative for 
the virus and positive for the common cold, said Friesen.

        

        “The risk remains low and we remain hopeful that we will not see 
confirmed cases of the virus in our province, but we are prepared in the
 event it does,” the minister said.  “We have excellent infection and 
prevention control procedures in place to help reduce the risk of 
illness.  Our proximity to the National Microbiology Laboratory, where 
confirmatory testing for the virus is occurring, is also a clear benefit
 to Manitobans in ensuring results are delivered promptly.”

        

        Public health officials in Manitoba are working closely with the Public
 Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the World Health Organization to 
monitor the situation as it evolves.

travel to the Hubei province of China, where Wuhan is located.
